With aging, mitochondrial efficiency declines, leading to an increase in ROS and persistent inflammatory responses. Therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial health show promise in mitigating these detrimental effects. Antioxidants such as MitoQ and MitoVitE, and supplements like coenzyme Q10 and NAD + precursors, have demonstrated potential in reducing oxidative stress. Additionally, gene therapy aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function, alongside lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and caloric restriction can ameliorate age-related mitochondrial decline. Exercise not only boosts mitochondrial biogenesis but also improves mitophagy. Enhancing mitophagy is a key strategy to prevent the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and longevity. Pharmacological agents like sulforaphane, SS-31, and resveratrol indirectly promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improve cellular resistance to oxidative damage. The exploration of mitochondrial therapeutics, including emerging techniques like mitochondrial transplantation, offers significant avenues for extending health span and combating age-related diseases. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires overcoming challenges in precisely targeting dysfunctional mitochondria and optimizing delivery mechanisms for therapeutic agents. Continued research is essential to refine these approaches and fully understand the interplay between mitochondrial dynamics and aging.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating mitochondrial dysfunction in aging\", \"category\": \"mitochondrial biology\", \"maturity\": \"preclinical\", \"explanation\": \"Mitochondrial therapeutics for aging and age-related diseases\"}",

Mitochondria are the primary ATP production sites and key regulators of programmed cell death. Consequently, these highly dynamic organelles play a central role in maintaining tissue function, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a pivotal factor in the progressive age-related decline in cellular homeostasis and organ function. The current review examines recent advances in understanding the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and organ-specific aging. Thereby, we dissect molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial impairment associated with the deterioration of organ function, exploring the role of mitochondrial DNA, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, metabolic activity, damage-associated molecular patterns, biogenesis, turnover, and dynamics. We also highlight emerging therapeutic strategies in preclinical and clinical tests that are supposed to rejuvenate mitochondrial function, such as antioxidants, mitochondrial biogenesis stimulators, and modulators of mitochondrial turnover and dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss potential benefits and challenges associated with the use of these interventions, emphasizing the need for organ-specific approaches given the unique mitochondrial characteristics of different tissues. In conclusion, this review highlights the therapeutic potential of addressing mitochondrial dysfunction to mitigate organ-specific aging, focusing on the skin, liver, lung, brain, skeletal muscle, and lung, as well as on the reproductive, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Based on a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of mitochondria, innovative therapeutic strategies may be developed and optimized to combat biological aging and promote healthy aging across diverse organ systems.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Reviewing mitochondrial dysfunction in aging\", \"category\": \"mitochondrial biology\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Mitochondrial dysfunction and therapeutic strategies\"}",

For centuries, people have been trying hard to understand the process of aging and find effective ways to delay it. However, limited breakthroughs have been made in anti-aging area. Since the hallmarks of aging were summarized in 2013, increasing studies focus on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and aging-related degenerative diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, osteoarthritis, metabolic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Accumulating evidence indicates that restoring mitochondrial function and biogenesis exerts beneficial effects in extending lifespan and promoting healthy aging.

As the world population ages, the prevalence of age-associated diseases, and their associated health care costs, has increased sharply. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to cellular dysfunction may provide important targets for interventions to prevent or treat these diseases. Recent Advances: Although the mitochondrial theory of aging had been proposed more than 40 years ago, recent new data have given stronger support for a central role for mitochondrial dysfunction in several pathways that are deregulated during normal aging and age-associated disease. Critical Issues: Several of the experimental evidence linking mitochondrial alterations to age-associated loss of function are correlative and mechanistic insights are still elusive. Here, we review how mitochondrial dysfunction may be involved in many of the known hallmarks of aging, and how these pathways interact in an intricate net of molecular relationships. Future Directions: As it has become clear that mitochondrial dysfunction plays causative roles in normal aging and age-associated diseases, it is necessary to better define the molecular interactions and the temporal and causal relationship between these changes and the relevant phenotypes seen during the aging process.

It exerts a context-dependent dual role in cancer initiation and progression, functioning as a tumor suppressor and promoter. The complexity of senescence in cancer arises from its mechanistic diversity, potential reversibility, and heterogeneity. A key mediator of these effects is the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a repertoire of bioactive molecules that influence tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling, modulate cancer cell behavior, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Given its intricate role in cancer biology, senescence presents both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Strategies targeting senescence pathways, including senescence-inducing therapies and senolytic approaches, offer promising avenues for cancer treatment. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular senescence in tumors. We also discuss emerging strategies to modulate senescence, highlighting novel therapeutic opportunities. A deeper understanding of these processes is essential for developing precision therapies and improving clinical outcomes.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Analyzing cellular senescence in cancer\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses senescence mechanisms and therapeutic targets\"}",

Therefore, cells that reach a senescent state prevent tumor initiation, acting as an anti-tumor mechanism. However, despite not being proliferative, senescent cells have high secretory activity, constituting the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). SASP includes thousands of soluble molecules and extracellular vesicles, through which senescent cells can affect other cells and the extracellular matrix. In advanced tumors, the enrichment of senescent cells can have anti- or pro-tumor effects depending on features like SASP composition, tumor microenvironment (TME) composition, the anatomic site, histopathologic characteristics of malignancy, and tumor molecular background. We reviewed the studies assessing the impact of the senescence status, measured by mRNA or lncRNA molecular signatures, in the prognosis and other clinically relevant information in cancer, including anti-tumor immunity and response to therapy.

This process can be triggered by diverse intracellular and extracellular stimuli. Senescent cells exhibit multiple hallmark features, including upregulation of cell cycle inhibitory proteins p16INK4a and p21Cip1, activation of DNA damage response, alterations in cellular architecture, and metabolic reprogramming. A prominent characteristic of senescent cells is their ability to secrete a heterogeneous array of bioactive molecules, collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These SASP components encompass cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and other signaling mediators that exert biological functions through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.With global population aging, osteoporosis has emerged as a critical public health challenge worldwide. Emerging evidence underscores the close association between osteoporosis and cellular senescence. During aging, the accumulation of senescent cells leads to enhanced SASP production, which contains pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators. These SASP factors not only propagate the senescence phenotype but also disrupt bone homeostasis by impairing the functionality of bone tissue cells, thereby accelerating skeletal aging. Recent advances highlight SASP as a promising therapeutic target for bone metabolic disorders such as osteoporosis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which SASP regulates bone cell populations remain incompletely elucidated.Addressing this knowledge gap, the present study aims to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of SASP in bone tissue cells, with the ultimate goal of providing mechanistic insights for developing novel strategies against age-related bone metabolic diseases.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigate SASP regulatory mechanisms in bone tissue cells\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"preclinical\", \"explanation\": \"Explores SASP's role in osteoporosis and bone aging\"}",

Due to its expression in various cell types and tissues and its interactions with other proteins, ANGPTL4 plays diverse roles within its family, exhibiting a wider range of molecular functions. For instance, ANGPTL4 is intricately involved in modulating central energy metabolism and enhancing exercise endurance, while also acting as a pivotal mediator in the interaction between gut microbiota and host lipid metabolism. Moreover, the expression of ANGPTL4 is directly controlled by aging-related signaling pathways. Its excessive activation accelerates the aging process by triggering mechanisms like heightened oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis, abnormal lipid accumulation, and cellular arrest, thereby advancing the development of age-related diseases. Given the pivotal roles of ANGPTL4 and its associated molecules in organ fibrosis and cancer advancement, targeting ANGPTL4 emerges as a promising therapeutic approach. However, the intricate and sometimes conflicting functions of the two cleavage fragments of ANGPTL4, namely N-terminal fragment (nANGPTL4) and C-terminal fragment (cANGPTL4), in different chronic diseases-exerting inhibitory or stimulatory effects depending on the disease stage-have posed challenges to the progress of ANGPTL4 antibody therapy. This review provides an overview of the biological mechanisms of ANGPTL4, its dual impact on fibrosis and tumorigenesis, and highlights its recent advancements as a potential biomarker in age-related diseases and inflammation-related conditions.

Its exceptionally short lifespan and rapid aging make it an ideal model for studying age-related phenomena in compressed timeframes. This species exhibits hallmarks of aging observed in longer-lived vertebrates, including motor neuron degeneration, muscle weakness, and impaired regenerative capacity. These features make it valuable for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms of age-related diseases and tissue regeneration. However, current research has primarily focused on brain aging and neurodegeneration, while systemic age-related changes across organs remain underexplored. The impact of aging on tissue regeneration in this model needs comprehensive investigation. This review summarizes current research using African turquoise killifish on age-related diseases and tissue regeneration in multiple organs. By integrating aging and regeneration biology, this review offers a perspective that expands the utility of this species beyond neurobiology, positioning it as a promising model for gerontology and regenerative medicine. We discuss limitations and future directions to advance its use in aging studies across multiple organs. Future research on African turquoise killifish will contribute to identifying therapeutic targets and developing interventions for age-related diseases, ultimately extending healthy life expectancy in humans.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating molecular mechanisms of age-related diseases\", \"category\": \"regenerative biology\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses future directions in aging research using African turquoise killifish model\"}",

Researchers have extensively studied GADD45α in tumor suppression, but its roles in healthy aging and age-related disorders remain underexplored. Here, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of recent findings illuminating GADD45α's contributions to aging biology. We detail its engagement with nucleotide and base excision repair pathways to preserve genome stability, enforce G₂/M checkpoints to prevent damaged DNA propagation, and promote mitochondrial resilience under oxidative challenge. We then examine how GADD45α modulates epigenetic landscapes, mitigating age-associated DNA methylation drift and sustaining chromatin plasticity, and highlight its emerging neuroprotective actions in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's models. Integrating multi-omics analyses, in vivo rodent investigations, and Drosophila lifespan assays, we establish GADD45α as a dynamic biomarker of cellular aging and a promising geroprotective target. Finally, we discuss translational strategies to harness GADD45α activity, ranging from small-molecule enhancers and epigenetic modifiers to precision gene-editing to reinforce DNA repair capacity, delay senescence onset, and extend organismal healthspan.

Although much research has addressed the comparison between these two groups at the level of the whole organism or organ level, like the musculoskeletal system, comparative studies at the cellular level remain limited. Therefore, this article aims to address this gap by conducting an extensive scoping review, comparing cell function and alterations with advanced age to those observed in altered gravity. The broad review spans different cell types and species, highlighting the generic nature of aging and its relationship to gravity. We identified 165 signs of aging at the cell level, deducted from leading aging papers, and grouped them into 11 themes: DNA and epigenetics, mitochondria, nucleus, immune system, protein and metabolism, lysosome and degradation, cell cycle, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix (ECM), cell mechanics, and cell signaling. Following this classification, we conducted a comprehensive search using the databases Web of Science and PubMed to examine the behavior of these signs in altered gravity conditions. The results reveal that only 29% of the responses are similar in (simulated) microgravity compared to biological aging, while others show contrasting behavior, thereby highlighting the complexity of cellular responses in these conditions. However, the majority of the signs remain unexplored in altered gravity. Mechanotransduction emerges as a potential key player in the observed phenotypic resemblances between aging and microgravity. Since there still is quite a lack of knowledge of aging-related effects on a cellular level in gravity-related research, we recommend further gravity research on the many components making up the links that facilitate mechanotransduction, which can aid in understanding the origins of these shared phenotypes and could lead to new insights into age-related and space-induced health challenges.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Identify cellular mechanisms of ageing in altered gravity\", \"category\": \"mechanotransduction/cell signalling\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Comparing cellular ageing to microgravity effects\"}",

While transient senescence contributes to beneficial processes such as tissue repair and tumor suppression, the persistent accumulation of senescent cells is implicated in tissue dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and age-related diseases. Notably, the SASP can exert both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, depending on cell type, tissue context, and temporal dynamics, particularly in early stages where it may be profibrotic and immunomodulatory. Recent advances in senotherapeutics have led to two principal strategies for targeting senescent cells: senolytics, which selectively induce their apoptosis, and senomorphics, which modulate deleterious aspects of the senescence phenotype, including the SASP, without removing the cells. This review critically examines the molecular mechanisms, therapeutic agents, and clinical potential of both approaches in the context of anti-aging interventions. We discuss major classes of senolytics, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, BCL-2 family inhibitors, and natural polyphenols, alongside senomorphics including mTOR and JAK inhibitors, rapalogs, and epigenetic modulators. Additionally, we explore the biological heterogeneity of senescent cells, challenges in developing specific biomarkers, and the dualistic role of senescence in physiological versus pathological states. The review also highlights emerging tools, such as targeted delivery systems, multi-omics integration, and AI-assisted drug discovery, which are advancing precision geroscience and shaping future anti-aging strategies.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Examines molecular mechanisms and therapeutic agents for targeting senescent cells\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses senotherapeutics and anti-aging interventions\"}",

Consequently, investigating the underlying mechanisms of aging and developing effective interventions to combat its effects have become increasingly important, as achieving healthy aging has emerged as a growing priority. A primary characteristic of aging is the epigenetic changes that occur within the genome. Epigenetic regulation, functioning as a reversible mechanism, closely links gene composition to phenotype and plays a crucial role in reversing aging in response to environmental stimuli. Epigenetics involves modifying phenotype or gene expression by regulating posttranscriptional levels without altering the DNA sequence. These mechanisms are vital to the aging process and are anticipated to become key targets for delaying aging and improving or preventing age-related diseases in the future. Recent studies have indicated that natural product therapy has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for mitigating the effects of aging. The application of natural products acting via the epigenetic regulation in therapy is particularly flexible and controllable, facilitating practical use while reducing the risk of drug resistance and enhancing host immune responses. This article reviews the current research status and advancements in epigenetic pathways within the realm of anti-aging drugs, proposing future research directions and potential development trends. The aim is to provide a reference for researchers in the field of epigenetics while offering ideas and suggestions for subsequent studies.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Reviews epigenetic pathways in anti-aging drugs\", \"category\": \"epigenetics\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses epigenetic mechanisms and interventions\"}",

According to the thermodynamic hypothesis of protein folding, soluble proteins precipitate into amyloids (pathology) under supersaturated conditions through a process similar to crystallization. This soluble-to-insoluble phase transition occurs via nucleation and may be catalyzed by ectopic surfaces such as lipid nanoparticles, microbes, or chemical pollutants. The increasing prevalence of these exposures with age correlates with the rising incidence of pathology over the lifespan. However, the formation of amyloid fibrils does not inherently cause neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration emerges when the levels of functional monomeric proteins, from which amyloids form, fall below a critical threshold. The preservation of monomeric proteins may explain neurological resilience, regardless of the extent of amyloid deposition. This biophysical framework challenges the traditional clinicopathological view that considers amyloids intrinsically toxic, despite the absence of a known mechanism of toxicity. Instead, it suggests that chronic exposures driving persistent nucleation consume monomeric proteins as they aggregate. In normal aging, replacement matches loss; in accelerated aging, it does not. A biophysical approach to neurodegenerative diseases has important therapeutic implications, refocusing treatment strategies from removing pathology to restoring monomeric protein homeostasis above the threshold needed to sustain normal brain function.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigates protein aggregation in age-related neurodegeneration\", \"category\": \"protein homeostasis\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses biophysical framework for protein aggregation\"}",

Emerging evidence underscores the brain-muscle-liver axis as a central hub for maintaining energy homeostasis and neuroimmune crosstalk during aging. Here, we elucidate how exercise orchestrates inter-organ communication to counteract age-related decline through metabolic reprogramming, immunomodulation, and neuroprotection. Mechanistically, exercise enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle via AMPK/PGC-1α signaling, restoring fatty acid oxidation and glucose metabolism while producing myokines (e.g., BDNF and IL-6) that promote neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Concurrently, hepatic SIRT1 activation promotes lipid metabolism, mitigates insulin resistance, and reduces systemic inflammation, hence preserving brain energy supply. In the aging brain, exercise stimulates neurogenesis, suppresses neuroinflammation via NF-κB inhibition, and elevates BDNF levels, which synergistically enhance cognitive resilience. vitally, exercise modulates the neuro-immunometabolic axis by balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6's hormetic role), optimizing immune cell function, and enhancing autophagy-mediated clearance of toxic aggregates (Aβ, α-synuclein). These adaptations are further amplified by epigenetic reprogramming, including but not limited to Nrf2-driven antioxidant responses and circadian rhythm synchronization. Our synthesis highlights exercise as a pleiotropic intervention that transcends single-organ influences, instead leveraging multi-tissue networks to delay aging and neurodegeneration. Unresolved challenges-personalized exercise regimens, molecular biomarkers for efficacy prediction, and combinatorial therapies with pharmacologic agents-underscore the need for translational studies integrating omics technologies and circadian biology.

Despite intensive efforts, early diagnosis and monitoring of AD remain challenging due to the lack of reliable biomarkers that can detect the disease in its preclinical stages. As a result, there exists a requirement for novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Extracellular vesicles provide the transfer of Aβ peptides and tau proteins between the cells and participates in the spreading/propagation of disease pathology. Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) that are found in plasma have emerged as promising candidates, especially for biomarker studies on neurodegenerative diseases because they are reachable and comparable with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. In addition to known proteins, synaptic proteins, transcription factors, or microRNAs have been suggested as new biomarkers, aiming to help differential or early diagnosis. Beyond their involvement in AD pathology, NDEVs also play essential roles in neurodevelopment and aging by mediating cell-to-cell communication and regulating processes such as synaptic formation, neuronal differentiation, and neuroinflammation. Age-related alterations in EV composition and secretion may contribute to the decline in neuroplasticity, thereby increasing susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Several challenges such as heterogeneous isolation of NDEVs limit the widespread clinical application of them as biomarkers for AD. Furthermore, the lack of standardized protocols for vesicle isolation and molecular analysis poses a barrier to reproducibility and clinical validation.

These actions, together with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-angiogenic properties, make quercetin a promising strategy for ocular diseases associated with visual impairment in older adults such as age-related macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. This review emphasizes the mechanisms by which quercetin exerts its protective effects, with particular attention to its ability to target cellular senescence, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate inflammation. Despite extensive preclinical evidence, the clinical application of quercetin remains limited due to challenges related to poor bioavailability, rapid degradation, and the absence of standardized ocular formulations. Progress in drug delivery systems, including nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and solid lipid carriers, provides promising strategies to overcome these barriers. In addition, combining quercetin with established treatments, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and neuroprotective drugs, may enhance its therapeutic potential in managing and possibly reversing age-related ophthalmic disorders.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating quercetin's senotherapeutic effects\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"preclinical\", \"explanation\": \"Quercetin's effects on cellular senescence and age-related diseases\"}",

Early detection is essential for timely intervention and slowing the progression of the disease. While the brain structures of healthy aging individuals change gradually, the aging trajectories in AD patients deviate significantly. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the detection of subtle changes in brain structures using neuroimaging data. By developing brain age prediction models based on data from healthy individuals, it is possible to estimate brain age at various stages of AD progression and assess the Brain Age Gap (BAG)-the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age-which holds promise as an early diagnostic biomarker for AD. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, for brain age prediction has attracted considerable attention. This systematic review provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of research in this field, focusing on the progress and limitations of machine learning techniques for brain age prediction. We place particular emphasis on deep learning methods, addressing data sources, model development, and interpretability. Additionally, we analyze key challenges in the field, including site effects, bias correction, insufficient data, hardware requirements, model accuracy, and clinical applicability.

Among the myriad of changes driven by age and sex, alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly collagen influence myocardial health in aging. Collagen, the predominant ECM protein, upholds tissue integrity and function through tightly regulated processes. Aging, a significant cardiovascular risk factor, is linked to increased collagen deposition, left ventricular remodelling, and fibrosis. Similarly, sex differences affect cardiovascular disease progression, with notable variations in the deposition of collagen types I and III between males and females. While collagen accumulation is present in aging in both sexes, females exhibit a tempered response until menopause, primarily due to oestrogen-mediated suppression of excessive collagen remodelling. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying age- and sex-related changes in cardiac collagen metabolism and their implications for myocardial health. Aging-associated fibrosis and collagen accumulation appear mechanistically distinct from those seen with injury or dysfunction, occurring without increased collagen synthesis despite elevated degradation enzymes. Factors such as senescence, inflammation, oxidative stress, and enhanced ECM crosslinking are identified as key drivers of these metabolic shifts. While studies in ovariectomized rodent models have highlighted the role of sex in collagen metabolism, evidence suggests that aging exerts a more dominant influence overall. Additionally, this review emphasizes a critical gap in the field: the limited availability of longitudinal aging fibrosis studies that include both sexes. This scarcity hampers a comprehensive understanding of how aging and sex collectively shape collagen turnover and myocardial health. By assessing these knowledge gaps, the review aims to define current perspectives and may provide insights to help inform the development of more effective, targeted therapeutic approaches.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating age- and sex-related changes in cardiac collagen metabolism\", \"category\": \"cardiovascular biology\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Aging and sex influence cardiac collagen metabolism\"}",

Radiotherapy (RT) continues to be crucial for tumor growth control when combined with surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. RT effectiveness depends on factors such as cancer type, tumor features, and the choice of external or internal treatment. Given its non-invasive nature and low systemic toxicity, RT is a suitable strategy for elderly patients. However, despite its efficacy, variations in cell sensitivity to radiation influence treatment outcomes, and normal cells surrounding the tumor can also be affected. Radiation-induced DNA damage can trigger cellular senescence, a permanent cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, contributing to tissue damage in healthy cells and radio-resistance in tumor cells. RT causes not only DNA breakage but also epigenetic remodeling. Epigenetic pathways are involved in RT response, and the radiosensitivity of tumor cells can be modulated using epigenetic compounds. Emerging treatments based on more precise forms of RT, such as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), offer promising results by selectively targeting tumors while potentially preserving healthy tissues. BNCT has shown efficacy in glioblastoma, recurrent head and neck carcinoma, and melanoma. This review i) examines the mechanisms and challenges of conventional RT, focusing on aging and its role in treatment efficacy and tolerability, ii) describes the impact of senescence and epigenetic factors on resistance, iii) explores advances in BNCT, and iv) considers the potential of epigenetic drugs to optimize RT outcomes.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigates radiation-induced cellular senescence and epigenetic changes\", \"category\": \"senescence/epigenetics\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses molecular mechanisms of ageing in cancer treatment\"}",

Epidemiological studies reveal that sarcopenia affects approximately 5-10% of the general population, with prevalence rates escalating dramatically after age 60 to reach 10-27% in older adults. This age-associated increase contributes significantly to healthcare burdens by elevating risks of disability, frailty, and mortality. Despite its profound impact, current clinical approaches to sarcopenia remain limited. While resistance exercise and protein supplementation form the cornerstone of management, their efficacy is often constrained by poor long-term adherence and variable individual responses, highlighting the urgent need for more comprehensive and personalized treatment strategies. The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and influenced by various factors, including aging, inflammation, nutritional deficits, physical inactivity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this condition are still not fully understood. Recent research has made significant strides in elucidating the intricate mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia, revealing novel insights into its molecular and cellular underpinnings. Notably, emerging evidence points to the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction, altered myokine profiles, and neuromuscular junction degeneration in sarcopenia progression. Additionally, breakthroughs in stem cell therapy, exosome-based treatments, and precision nutrition offer promising avenues for clinical intervention. This review aims to synthesize the latest advancements in sarcopenia research, focusing on the novel contributions to its pathogenesis and treatment strategies. We explore emerging trends such as the role of cellular senescence, epigenetic regulation, and targeted therapeutic interventions that could reshape future approaches to managing sarcopenia.

Accumulation of senescent cells promotes chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction, age-related diseases, and tumor suppression. Recent advancements in immunotherapy have positioned T cell-based approaches as precision tools for the targeted clearance of senescent cells, offering a novel avenue for anti-aging interventions. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular senescence, focusing on its immunogenic features and interactions with T cells, including T-cell activation, antigen recognition, modulation of tumor microenvironment (TME), and immune evasion strategies. Innovations such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, immune checkpoint therapies, and SASP-neutralizing approaches are highlighted as breakthrough strategies for enhancing senescent cell eradication.

In recent years, evidence have shown that patients with OSA may have this disorder for different reasons, with different symptoms and comorbidities. Therefore, treatment should be individualized [1]. This has led to a growing interest in the characterization of the disease into phenotypes. OSA in elderly patients is often a challenge for clinician in terms of diagnosis, as symptoms may be masked, but also for treatment in terms of efficacy and adherence. However, aging is a pathophysiological factor that predisposes to obstructive sleep apnea, and the two conditions share symptoms and comorbidities to such an extent that it becomes very difficult to establish a casual link between the two. We summarize the recent evidence in OSA elderly patients, particularly in terms of pathophysiology, symptoms and main comorbidities.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": false, \"explanation\": \"purely clinical focus on sleep apnea in elderly patients\"}",

As an emerging cross-species regulatory \"natural force\", PDNVs have attracted considerable interest due to their excellent biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and remarkable therapeutic effects in tissue injury and aging-related diseases. In this review, we examine the bioactive components, drug delivery potential, and functional mechanisms of PDNVs, and we summarize recent advances in their applications for tissue repair and antiaging. In addition, we systematically discuss the major challenges and limitations hindering the clinical translation and industrialization of PDNVs, and we propose five strategic approaches along with future research directions.

Severe COVID-19 infection was reported to be associated with altered immunometabolism and cytokine storms, contributing to poor clinical outcomes and in many cases resulting in mortality. Despite promising preclinical results, many drugs have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials, highlighting the need for novel approaches to combat the virus and its severe manifestations. Mitochondria, crucial for aerobic respiration, play a pivotal role in modulating immunometabolism and neuronal function, making their compromised capability as central pathological mechanism contributing to the development of neurological complications in COVID-19. Dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics can lead to uncontrolled immune responses, underscoring the importance of mitochondrial regulation in shaping clinical outcomes. Aging further accelerates mitochondrial dysfunction, compounding immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, making older adults particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae. COVID-19 infection impairs mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to the long-term neurological complications associated with the disease. Additionally, recent reports also suggest that up to 30% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering neurological issues, thereby highlighting the critical need for further research into mitochondrial pathways to mitigate long-tern neurological consequences of Covid-19. This review examines the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID-19-induced neurological complications, its connection to aging, and potential biomarkers for clinical diagnostics.

In the tumor microenvironment, senescent T cells lead to the inability of tumor cells to be effectively eliminated, triggering immunosuppression, which in turn affects the efficacy of immunotherapy. This is a strong indication that T-cell senescence significantly weakens the immune function of the body, making individuals, especially elderly patients with cancer, more vulnerable to cancer attacks. Despite the many challenges, T-cell senescence is important as a potential therapeutic target. This review provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of T-cell senescence and its research advances in patients with cancer, especially in older adults, and systematically analyzes potential intervention strategies, including molecular mechanism-based interventions, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T cell therapy.

The aging of immune system, namely \"immunosenescence\", has been reported to be correlated with high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with sepsis. Initially, immunosenescence was considered as a range of age-related alterations in the immune system. However, increasing evidence has proven that persistent inflammation or even a short-term inflammatory challenge during sepsis could trigger accelerated aging of immune cells, which might further exacerbate inflammatory cytokine storm and promote the shift towards immunosuppression. Thus, premature immunosenescence is found in young sepsis individuals, which further aggravates immune disorders and induces the progression of sepsis. Furthermore, in old sepsis patients, the synergistic effects of both sepsis and aging may cause immunosenescence-associated alterations more significantly, resulting in more severe immune dysfunction and a worse prognosis.

Cellular senescence arises naturally through replicative exhaustion and is accelerated by clinical treatments or environmental stressors. The accumulation of senescent cells-defined by a loss of mitogenic potential, resistance to apoptosis, and acquisition of a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype-has been implicated as a key driver of chronic disease, tissue degeneration, and organismal aging. Recent studies have highlighted the therapeutic promise of senolytic drugs, which selectively eliminate senescent cells. Compelling results from preclinical animal studies and ongoing clinical trials underscore this potential. However, the clinical translation of senolytics requires further pharmacological validation to refine selectivity, minimize toxicity, and determine optimal dosing. Equally important is the evaluation of senolytics' potential to restore tissue structure and function by reducing the senescent cell burden. In vitro tissue culture models offer a powerful platform to advance these efforts. This review summarizes the current landscape of in vitro systems used for inducing cellular senescence-referred to as \"senescence assays\"-and for screening senolytic drugs-referred to as \"senolytic assays\". We conclude by discussing key challenges to improving mechanistic insight, predictive accuracy, and clinical relevance in senolytic drug development, as well as emerging applications of senolytic therapies.\"\"\"": "{ \"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Discussing challenges in senolytic drug development\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Senolytic therapies for cellular senescence\" }",

This review explores key mechanisms, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage heart muscle cells, contributing to fibrosis and cellular aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces energy production and increases oxidative stress, accelerating cardiac decline. Impaired autophagy limits the removal of damaged proteins and organelles, while inflammation activates signaling molecules that drive tissue remodeling. Gender differences reveal estrogen's protective role in premenopausal women, with men showing greater susceptibility to heart muscle dysfunction and injury. After menopause, women lose this hormonal protection, increasing their risk of cardiovascular conditions. Ethnic disparities, particularly among underserved minority populations, emphasize how social factors such as access to care, environment, and chronic stress contribute to worsening cardiovascular outcomes. The coronavirus disease pandemic has introduced further challenges by increasing the incidence of heart damage through inflammation, blood clots, and long-term heart failure, especially in older adults with existing metabolic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. The virus's interaction with receptors on heart and blood vessel cells, along with a weakened immune response in older adults, intensifies cardiac aging. Emerging therapies include delivery of therapeutic extracellular vesicles, immune cell modulation, and treatments targeting mitochondria. In addition, lifestyle strategies such as regular physical activity, nutritional improvements, and stress reduction remain vital to maintaining cardiac health.

Among the most influential are Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which aims to counteract biological decline through targeted damage repair, and the Hallmarks of Aging (HoA), which seeks to identify fundamental mechanisms underlying this process. Both proposals, although diverse, significantly influence contemporary approaches to the challenges posed by aging. However, despite extensive discussion, we contend that key conceptual and methodological aspects remain insufficiently explored. This paper seeks to advance the debate by critically analyzing and comparing their foundational goals, theoretical premises, and research frameworks. Specifically, we examine their definitions of aging, perspectives on health and disease, approaches to scientific evidence and causal interventions, and communications strategies. In doing so, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding and more nuanced assessment of both SENS and the HoA.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Analyzing SENS and HoA frameworks\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Comparing foundational goals and research frameworks\"}",

Aging is a complex, multifactorial process shaped by many factors including genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. While medical advancements have extended lifespan, healthspan remains constrained by cellular senescence, telomere attrition, and systemic inflammation-core hallmarks of biological aging. However, emerging evidence suggests that telomere dynamic is not inevitable but can be influenced by oxidative stress, lifestyle choices, and metabolic regulation. This review examines how telomere-based biomarkers and metabolic interventions can drive personalized longevity medicine, enabling targeted strategies to delay aging. Furthermore, it highlights the integration of geroscience into clinical practice-integrated longevity medicine leveraging biomarker tracking, metabolic therapies, and preventive interventions-to redefine aging as a modifiable process, ultimately extending both lifespan and healthspan.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Examines telomere-based biomarkers and metabolic interventions for personalized longevity medicine\", \"category\": \"telomere biology/metabolism\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses telomere dynamics and metabolic interventions for ageing\"}",

Currently, the main drugs for AD are cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. However, their therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory, highlighting the urgent need for a new treatment strategy for AD. Cell senescence (CS) is a complex stress response. Recently, an increasing number of studies have indicated that CS is a crucial factor in AD pathogenesis. CS can be used as a potential drug target for AD treatment. However, the specific mechanism of CS in AD remains unclear. This article reviews AD pathogenesis, the mechanisms associated with CS in AD, and the CS-based therapeutic drugs for AD including chemical agents and traditional Chinese medicine. Based on this, this review also summarized the clinical feasibility and challenges of CS-based therapies and aims to provide novel insights for developing effective therapeutic strategies against AD. This review serves as a reference for clarifying the relationship between CS and AD, providing new insights into the clinical treatment of AD.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Reviews cell senescence in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses cell senescence as a potential drug target\"}",

Endothelial function and proper arterial blood flow through the hypogastric and pudendal arteries are critical in women for a normal vasculogenic response to sexual stimulation. Organic causes of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) often stem from neuropathy or vascular complications linked to cardiovascular risk factors. The relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and FSD is multifactorial, influenced by various factors such as disease severity, physical and physiological factors, social determinants and factors related to medication use. Additionally, the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in FSD of CVD patients include vascular, physical, psychological and hormonal factors. Hypertension, stroke, and myocardial infarction are closely interrelated with FSD, which is not the case for coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, and peripheral obstructive artery disease. Hormonal treatment for sexual dysfunction in women with cardiovascular risk factors is discussed, concerning menopausal hormone therapy, tibolone, selective estrogen receptor modulators, vaginal estrogen, prasterone and testosterone therapy. On the other hand, the beneficial effect of sexual activity on cardiovascular health has been gaining supportive evidence. In healthy postmenopausal women aged 45-60, penile-vaginal intercourse has been suggested to positively influence cardiac autonomic functions, as indicated by heart rate variability. However, effectively addressing the challenges of aging and further highlighting the positive impact of sexual activity on cardiac health in selected female populations could significantly enhance life motivation and promote a healthy lifestyle during this stage.

This trend has prompted extensive efforts within many scientific and medical communities to develop and enhance therapies aimed at delaying aging processes, mitigating aging-related functional decline, and addressing aging-associated diseases to extend health span. Research in aging biology has focused on unraveling various biochemical and genetic pathways contributing to aging-related changes, including genomic instability, telomere shortening, and cellular senescence. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived through reprogramming human somatic cells, has revolutionized disease modeling and understanding in humans by addressing the limitations of conventional animal models and primary human cells. iPSCs offer significant advantages over other pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells, as they can be obtained without the need for embryo destruction and are not restricted by the availability of healthy donors or patients. These attributes position iPSC technology as a promising avenue for modeling and deciphering mechanisms that underlie aging and associated diseases, as well as for studying drug effects. Moreover, iPSCs exhibit remarkable versatility in differentiating into diverse cell types, making them a promising tool for personalized regenerative therapies aimed at replacing aged or damaged cells with healthy, functional equivalents.

While transient SASP aids wound healing, its chronic activation drives inflammation, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. This review examines SASP's molecular regulation, dual roles in health and pathology, and therapeutic potential. The following two main strategies are explored: senescence clearance, which eliminates SASP-producing cells, and SASP modulation, which refines secretion to suppress inflammation while maintaining regenerative effects. Key pathways, including NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and cGAS-STING, are discussed alongside pharmacological, immunotherapeutic, gene-editing, and epigenetic interventions. SASP heterogeneity necessitates tissue-specific biomarkers for personalized therapies. Challenges include immune interactions, long-term safety, and ethical considerations.

In young organisms, it acts as a barrier against tumorigenesis, but in the aging population, it may facilitate tumor growth and metastasis through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in the immune system, particularly in the surveillance, targeting, and elimination of malignant and senescent cells. However, age-related immunosenescence is characterized by declining NK cell function resulting in diminished ability to fight infection, eliminate senescent cells and suppress tumor development. This implies that preserving or augmenting NK cell function may be central to defense against age-related degenerative and malignant diseases. This review explores the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions, focusing on how aging influences the battle between the immune system and cancer, the implications of senescent NK cells in disease progression, and the potential of adoptive NK cell therapy as a countermeasure to these age-related immunological challenges.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Exploring interactions between immune system and cancer in aging\", \"category\": \"immunology/senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses cellular senescence and immunosenescence in cancer biology\"}",

Among the many risk factors for neurodegeneration, aging is the major risk factor. In the context of aging, multiple factors lead to the release of endogenous DNA (especially mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA), which is an important trigger for the activation of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway. Recent studies have identified an increasing role for activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway as a driver of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) in aging and NDDs. The cGAS-STING pathway mediates the immune sensing of DNA and is a key driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during the aging process. Blocking cGAS-STING signaling may reduce the inflammatory response by preventing mtDNA release and enhancing mitophagy. Targeted inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway by biological macromolecules such as natural products shows promise in therapeutic strategies for age-related NDDs. This review aims to systematically and comprehensively introduces the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in age-related NDDs in the context of aging while revealing the molecular mechanisms of the cGAS-STING pathway and its downstream signaling pathways and to develop more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies for NDDs.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating cGAS-STING pathway in age-related neurodegenerative diseases\", \"category\": \"immunology\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"cGAS-STING pathway's role in aging and neurodegeneration\"}",

Significant gaps remain in our understanding of site-specific histone modification impacts on cardiac function, the intricate crosstalk between different histone marks, and their integration with metabolic alterations that characterize the aging myocardium. Current evidence reveals a dynamic epigenetic signature in aged cardiac tissue, typically featuring increased transcriptional activation markers alongside decreased repressive marks, though context-dependent variations exist. This review explores how histone modifications influence critical pathways governing mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage repair, inflammation, and fibrosis in aging hearts.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced CVD is essential for developing targeted therapies to mitigate these effects and improve long-term outcomes for patients with cancer. Recent Advances: Recent studies have primarily focused on metabolic alterations induced by irradiation in various cancer cell types. However, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the role of chronic metabolic alterations in normal cells, particularly vascular cells, in the progression of CVD after RT. Critical Issues: This review centers on RT-induced metabolic alterations in vascular cells and their contribution to senescence accumulation and chronic inflammation across the vasculature post-RT. We discuss key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid metabolism, glutamine metabolism, and redox metabolism (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)/NADPH). We further explore the roles of regulatory proteins such as p53, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin in driving these metabolic dysregulations. The review emphasizes the impact of immune-vascular crosstalk mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which perpetuates metabolic dysfunction, enhances chronic inflammation, drives senescence accumulation, and causes vascular damage, ultimately contributing to cardiovascular pathogenesis. Future Directions: Future research should prioritize identifying therapeutic targets within these metabolic pathways or the immune-vascular interactions influenced by RT. Correcting metabolic dysfunction and reducing chronic inflammation through targeted therapies could significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes in cancer survivors. Antioxid.

CKD exacerbates sarcopenia through complex molecular and cellular mechanisms, including chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, uremic toxin accumulation, protein-energy wasting, and hormonal dysregulation. This review explores the interplay between CKD and sarcopenia, focusing on key pathways such as mTOR signaling, the AMPK-FOXO axis, and myostatin/activin pathways that regulate muscle protein metabolism. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired autophagy emerge as critical contributors to muscle wasting. Clinical implications include identifying biomarkers such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, myostatin, and Klotho for diagnosis and monitoring, while potential therapeutic strategies involve targeting the AMPK/mTOR pathway, enhancing mitochondrial function, and inhibiting myostatin activity. Emerging approaches, including multi-omics technologies and AI-driven personalized treatment models, offer innovative solutions for understanding and managing the CKD-sarcopenia axis. This review underscores the need for integrated therapeutic strategies and multidisciplinary collaboration to mitigate muscle wasting and improve outcomes in CKD patients.

Numerous models ranging from two-dimensional (2D) cell-based, invertebrate, vertebrate, and sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) models have been used to understand the process of brain aging. Invertebrate models are ideal for researching conserved aging processes because of their simplicity, short lifespans, and genetic tractability. Moreover, vertebrate models, including zebrafish and rodents, exhibit more complex nervous systems and behaviors, enabling the exploration of age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. 2D cell culture models derived from primary cells or immortalized cell lines are widely used for mechanistic studies at the cellular level but lack the physiological complexity of brain tissue. Recent advancements have shifted focus to 3D models, which better recapitulate the brain's microenvironment. Organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells mimic human brain architecture and enable the study of cell-cell interactions and aging in a human-specific context. Brain-on-a-chip systems integrate microfluidics and 3D cultures to model blood-brain barrier dynamics and neuronal networks. Additionally, scaffold-based 3D cultures and spheroids provide intermediate complexity, allowing researchers to study extracellular matrix interactions and age-related changes in neuronal function. These 3D models bridge the gap between traditional 2D cultures and animal-based in vivo studies, offering unprecedented insights into brain aging mechanisms. By combining these diverse models, researchers can unravel the multifaceted processes of brain aging and accelerate the development of targeted therapies for age-related neurodegenerative disorders.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Understanding brain aging mechanisms\", \"category\": \"neurobiology\", \"maturity\": \"preclinical\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses models for studying brain aging\"}",

Thus, ageing of the global population will pose major social, medical, and economic challenges unless this ill health can be ameliorated or reversed. Accordingly, it is increasingly clear that cross-disciplinary approaches to understanding ageing, although not essential, allow collaborative teams to develop new methodologies which can accelerate translation of research into interventions. Co-creation of new concepts and technologies also brings reciprocal benefits to the individual disciplines involved. The evolution of human ageing is a case in point. Whilst there is broad consensus concerning the process and factors shaping the evolution of ageing in general their relative contributions to the evolution of human ageing remain less clear. This is due to three distinct factors. The extended genetic bottlenecks to which H. sapiens was exposed until the termination of the last ice age which sharply distinguishes our species from almost all current ageing models. Sociality, which humans share with many, but not all, living primate species; and finally, an extended post reproductive menopausal period which is extremely rare in the biosphere and uniquely long in humans. Accordingly, a symposium on the physiology and demography of early human evolution was organised by the authors at which palaeodemographers, archaeologists, population biologists and geroscientists discussed human ageing. This has generated important interdisciplinary research priorities which could accelerate the development of treatments for older people in the present and transform key aspects of our understanding of the ageing process in the past.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Identify research priorities for understanding human ageing\", \"category\": \"geroscience\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses interdisciplinary approaches to understanding ageing\"}",

Understanding the mechanisms underlying cerebromicrovascular aging is crucial for devising strategies to mitigate this burden. Among the key hallmarks of aging, genomic instability and genetic heterogeneity have emerged as significant drivers of age-related diseases. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a prominent manifestation of this instability, characterized by the non-malignant expansion of hematopoietic stem cell clones that harbor somatic mutations. CHIP is well-established as a contributor to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease through its promotion of chronic inflammation. Given that aging is also a major risk factor for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and VCID, it is likely that the same aging processes driving large artery atherosclerosis in CHIP carriers also impair small vessels, including the cerebral microvasculature. While the role of CHIP in large vessel disease is well-documented, its specific contributions to cerebrovascular aging and microvascular dysfunction remain poorly understood. This review explores the potential role of CHIP in age-related cerebrovascular pathologies, with a particular focus on its contribution to CSVD. We discuss how CHIP-related mutations can promote inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially leading to endothelial dysfunction, dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, microvascular inflammation, and cerebral microhemorrhages. Given the potential implications for VCID, elucidating these mechanisms is critical for developing targeted therapies aimed at reducing the burden of cognitive decline in aging populations. This review aims to highlight the current knowledge gaps and encourage further research into the intersection of CHIP, CSVD, and cognitive aging.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Exploring CHIP's role in cerebrovascular aging\", \"category\": \"vascular biology\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses knowledge gaps in CHIP's contribution to CSVD\"}",

Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate in the body with age and secrete harmful substances known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), causing chronic inflammation; at the same time, chronic inflammation leads to a decrease in immune system function, known as immunosenescence, which further accelerates the aging process. Cellular senescence and immunosenescence are closely related to a variety of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Studying the mechanisms of cellular senescence and immunosenescence and developing targeted interventions are crucial for improving the immune function and quality of life of elderly people. Here, we review a series of recent studies focusing on the molecular mechanisms of cellular senescence and immunosenescence, the regulation of aging by the immune system, and the latest advances in basic and clinical research on senolytics.

Curcumin has shown multiple anti-inflammatory and brain-protective effects, but its clinical use is limited by challenges like poor absorption, specificity and delivery to the right tissues. A range of contemporary approaches at the intersection with bioengineering and systems biology are being explored to address these challenges. Data from preclinical and human studies highlight various neuroprotective actions of curcumin, including the inhibition of neuroinflammation, modulation of critical cellular signaling pathways, promotion of neurogenesis, and regulation of dopamine levels. However, curcumin's multifaceted effects - such as its impact on microRNAs and senescence markers - suggest novel therapeutic targets in neurodegeneration. Tetrahydrocurcumin, a primary metabolite of curcumin, also shows potential due to its presence in circulation and its anti-inflammatory properties, although further research is needed to elucidate its neuroprotective mechanisms. Recent advancements in delivery systems, particularly brain-targeting nanocarriers like polymersomes, micelles, and liposomes, have shown promise in enhancing curcumin's bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy in animal models. Furthermore, the exploration of drug-laden scaffolds and dermal delivery may extend the pharmacological applications of curcumin. Studies reviewed here indicate that engineered dermal formulations and devices could serve as viable alternatives for neuroprotective treatments and to manage skin or musculoskeletal inflammation.

Comparing in vitro and in vivo mouse studies, and in vitro studies in humans, supported by visualizations of data interconnections, we show consistent patterns in how such reprogramming modulates key biological processes. Generally, partial reprogramming drives dynamic chromatin remodelling, involving histone modifications that regulate accessibility and facilitate pluripotency gene activation while silencing somatic identity. These changes are accompanied by modifications in stress response programs, such as inflammation, autophagy, and cellular senescence, as well as improved mitochondrial activity and dysregulation of extracellular matrix pathways. We also underscore the challenges in evaluating complex processes like aging and cellular senescence, given the variability in biomarkers used across studies.

Accordingly, long-lived individuals, such as nonagenarians and centenarians, who remain free from chronic diseases, provide a valuable model to investigate the complex interplay of biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to exceptional longevity. Although there are other longevity hotspots worldwide, five regions, known as Blue Zones, are widely recognized for their exceptionally long-lived populations. Among the various determinants of healthy ageing, the eating patterns of long-lived individuals in Blue Zones include a variety of polyphenol-rich foods, which may contribute to their healthy phenotype. A significant body of evidence suggests that polyphenols, a large family of compounds ubiquitously found in plant-based foods, may exhibit geroprotective activity by influencing underlying biological mechanisms of ageing and promoting optimal longevity. While identifying several knowledge gaps that future investigations should address, the goal of this review is to provide an overview of how specific polyphenols found in foods commonly consumed by long-lived individuals residing in the Blue Zones may mitigate the risk of age-related diseases. Additionally, we discuss how these compounds, by acting on evolutionarily conserved mechanisms associated with ageing, have the potential to modulate the intricate network of the hallmarks of ageing.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigate polyphenols' role in healthy ageing\", \"category\": \"metabolism\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses polyphenols' geroprotective activity\"}",

We propose that these abrupt molecular shifts could serve as biomarkers, dividing the lifespan into distinct stages and providing the foundation for a much-needed staging system for aging.

Despite various measurement tools, there is no universal standard. The University of Jyväskylä Active Ageing Scale (UJACAS) is increasingly used in Europe but faces inconsistencies from varying response scales across versions. This perspective paper examines these discrepancies and proposes a refined model for AA measurement, emphasizing the dimensions of motivation, ability, opportunity, and activity frequency. The goal is to improve the accuracy of AA assessments by adjusting for personal and environmental limitations, ensuring a fair evaluation that captures the complexities of ageing. The proposed adjustments to the UJACAS scoring model include recalibrating the equation to account for personal and environmental limitations, integrating motivation as a separate measure, and exploring adaptive methodologies to ensure fairer and more nuanced assessments of Active Ageing, particularly for individuals facing disabilities or obstacles. By addressing these issues, this perspective paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of AA tools for older adults. Moreover, adopting these methodological challenges has significant societal implications. Precise measurement of AA is essential for tailoring interventions to the needs of diverse older populations and for designing policies that promote inclusive, healthy and safe ageing. Enhancing the accuracy of AA assessments can inform strategies that empower older adults, mitigate disparities, and foster resilience in ageing communities. This study highlights the necessity of advancing AA measurement frameworks to support evidence-based decisions in public health and social policy.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": false, \"explanation\": \"focuses on societal and policy aspects of ageing, not molecular or cellular mechanisms\"}",

Researchers worldwide are dedicated to developing effective therapeutics to target cancer cells. One promising strategy involves inducing cellular senescence, a complex state in which cells exit the cell cycle. Senescence has profound effects on both physiological and pathological processes, influencing cellular systems through secreted factors that affect surrounding and distant cells. Among these factors are exosomes, small extracellular vesicles that play crucial roles in cellular communication, development, and defense, and can contribute to pathological conditions. Recently, there has been increasing interest in engineering exosomes as precise drug delivery vehicles, capable of targeting specific cells or intracellular components. Studies have emphasized the significant role of exosomes from senescent cells in cancer progression and therapy. Notably, chemotherapeutic agents can alter the tumor microenvironment, induce senescence, and trigger immune responses through exosome-mediated cargo transfer. This review explores the intricate relationship between cellular senescence, exosomes, and cancer, examining how different therapeutics can eliminate cancer cells or promote drug resistance. It also investigates the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways driving these processes, highlighting current challenges and proposing future perspectives to uncover new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating exosomes in cancer therapy\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Exploring senescence and exosomes in cancer\"}",

As the population ages, the incidence of brain tumors, including GBM, increases, with aging emerging as a significant prognostic factor influencing survival outcomes. This review examines the molecular mechanisms linking aging and brain tumor progression, with a specific focus on glioblastomas. We explore how age-related genetic mutations, alterations in cellular pathways, and changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53, and EGFR/PTEN, which are frequently dysregulated in both aging and brain tumors. Despite the growing recognition of aging as a critical factor in brain tumor biology, therapeutic strategies for elderly patients remain poorly defined, often due to underrepresentation in clinical trials and the complex interplay of comorbidities and treatment side effects.

However, as the immune system ages, its functionality can deteriorate, becoming dysfunctional, inefficient, or even inactive-a condition referred to as immunosenescence. This decline significantly increases the risk of malignancies. While the pro-cancer effects of T-cell aging have been widely explored, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the impact of aging on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. This review seeks to address this gap, with emphasis on these cell types. Furthermore, although certain cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of cancers, elderly patients are less likely to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. In some cases, they may even experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While senolytic strategies have shown promise in exerting anti-cancer effects, their adverse reactions and potential off-target effects present significant challenges.

The risk of developing PD dramatically increases with advanced age, indicating that aging is likely a driving factor in PD neuropathogenesis. Several age-associated biological changes are also hallmarks of PD neuropathology, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Accumulation of senescent cells is an important feature of aging that contributes to age-related diseases. How age-related cellular senescence affects brain health and whether this phenomenon contributes to neuropathogenesis in PD is not yet fully understood. In this review, we highlight hallmarks of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of proteostasis, genomic instability and telomere attrition in relation to well established PD neuropathological pathways. We then discuss the hallmarks of cellular senescence in the context of neuroscience and review studies that directly examine cellular senescence in PD. Studying senescence in PD presents challenges and holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, which could contribute to the development of effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Targeting senescent cells or modulating the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in PD requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between PD pathogenesis and cellular senescence.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating cellular senescence in Parkinson's disease\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses age-related cellular senescence in PD neuropathogenesis\"}",

As global populations grow older, age-related conditions increasingly determine healthspan and lifespan. The circulatory system not only supplies nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the human body and removes by-products but also builds the largest interorgan communication network, thereby serving as a gatekeeper for healthy ageing. Therefore, elucidating organ-specific and cell-specific ageing mechanisms that compromise circulatory system functions could have the potential to prevent or ameliorate age-related cardiovascular diseases. In support of this concept, emerging evidence suggests that targeting the circulatory system might restore organ function. In this Roadmap, we delve into the organ-specific and cell-specific mechanisms that underlie ageing-related changes in the cardiovascular system. We raise unanswered questions regarding the optimal design of clinical trials, in which markers of biological ageing in humans could be assessed. We provide guidance for the development of gerotherapeutics, which will rely on the technological progress of the diagnostic toolbox to measure residual risk in elderly individuals. A major challenge in the quest to discover interventions that delay age-related conditions in humans is to identify molecular switches that can delay the onset of ageing changes. To overcome this roadblock, future clinical trials need to provide evidence that gerotherapeutics directly affect one or several hallmarks of ageing in such a manner as to delay, prevent, alleviate or treat age-associated dysfunction and diseases.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Identify molecular switches to delay ageing\", \"category\": \"cardiovascular ageing\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses ageing mechanisms and future directions\"}",

This review focuses on the ageing of lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs), which are crucial for maintaining lymph node (LN) structure and function. Age-related changes in LNs, such as fibrosis and lipomatosis, disrupt the LN architecture and reduce immune cell recruitment and function, impairing immune responses to infections and vaccinations. The review discusses the structural and functional decline of various LNSC subsets, including fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and blood endothelial cells (BECs), highlighting their roles in immune cell activation and homeostasis. Potential strategies to restore aged LNSC function, such as enhancing LNSC activation during vaccination and using senotherapeutics, are explored. Outstanding questions regarding the mechanisms of LNSC ageing and how ageing of the LN stroma might impact autoimmune disorders are also addressed.

To elucidate the metabolic imbalances arising from aging, we introduce the concept of \"metabolaging.\" This framework encompasses the broad spectrum of metabolic disruptions associated with the hallmarks of aging, including the functional decline of key metabolically active organs, like the adipose tissue. By examining how these organs interact with essential nutrient-sensing pathways, \"metabolaging\" provides a more comprehensive view of the systemic metabolic imbalances that occur with age. This concept extends to understanding how age-related metabolic disturbances can influence the response to acute stressors, like burn injuries, highlighting the interplay between metabolic dysfunction and the ability to handle severe physiological challenges.

This perspective study examines their interplay, highlighting their combined potential to preserve muscle mass, cognitive function, and quality of life. The objective is to address gaps in the current understanding, such as the frequent neglect of dietary intake in exercise interventions and vice versa, which can limit their effectiveness. Through a synthesis of the existing literature, we identify key findings, emphasizing the importance of adequate nutritional intake-particularly protein, essential amino acids, and micronutrients-in supporting exercise benefits and preventing sarcopenia and malnutrition. Additionally, supplementation strategies, such as omega-3 fatty acids, creatine, and essential amino acids, are explored alongside the emerging role of the gut microbiota in mediating the benefits of nutrition and exercise. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including determining optimal dosages and timing and addressing individual variability in responses. Personalized approaches tailored to sex differences, gut microbiota diversity, and baseline health conditions are critical for maximizing intervention outcomes.

Initially seen as a cellular aging mechanism, it is now recognized for its roles in development, tissu repair and tumour suppression. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. Recent efforts have focused on \"senotherapeutics\", including senolytics, which aim to eliminate senescent cells to mitigate age-related decline. Despite significant advances, senescence research faces critical challenges because of inconsistent detection methods. Common markers, such as p16INK4a and senescence-associated β-galactosidase, vary across tissues and contexts, complicating cross-study comparisons and clinical applications. A standardized multifaceted approach to senescence detection is essential, and should incorporate complementary methods, clear thresholds for senescence classification and considerations for cell type-specific variations.

The kidneys, in particular, experience function decline, reduced regenerative capacity, and increased susceptibility to injury as they age. As a result, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rises with aging, further contributing to the growing health burden in older populations. One of the key factors in this process is the dysfunction of specialized renal endothelial cells (RECs), which are essential for maintaining kidney health by regulating blood flow and supporting filtration, solute and water reabsorption, and vascular integrity. As the kidneys age, REC dysfunction drives vascular and microenvironmental changes, contributing to the overall decline in kidney function. In this review, we outline the structural and functional effects of aging on the kidney's macrovascular and microvascular compartments and provide a phenotypic description of the aged endothelium. We particularly focus on the molecular and metabolic rewiring driving and sustaining growth-arrested EC senescence phenotype. We finally give an overview of senotherapies acting on ECs, especially of those modulating metabolism. Given that the pathophysiological processes underlying kidney aging largely overlap with those observed in CKD, REC rejuvenation could also benefit patients with CKD. Moreover, such interventions may hold promise in improving the outcomes of aged kidney transplants. Hence, advancing our understanding of REC and kidney aging will create opportunities for innovations that could improve outcomes for both elderly individuals and patients with CKD.\"\"\"": "{\"relevant\": true, \"task\": \"Investigating REC dysfunction in kidney aging\", \"category\": \"senescence\", \"maturity\": \"review\", \"explanation\": \"Discusses molecular mechanisms of ageing in kidney endothelial cells\"}",

MAMs serve as dynamic communication hubs between the ER and mitochondria, orchestrating essential processes such as calcium signalling, lipid metabolism and cellular stress responses. Recent research has implicated MAM dysfunction in a wide array of conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The significant lack of biological knowledge behind MAM function emphasizes the need to study these enigmatic subcellular sites in greater detail.

Recent progress in immunotherapy has elicited attracted considerable attention as a viable treatment option through modulating the host immune system and unleashing pre-existing immunity, which has profoundly revolutionized oncology, especially GC. Nonetheless, low clinical response and intrinsic and acquired resistance remain persistently challenging. The microenvironment of GC comprising multifarious stromal cell types has remarkable immunosuppressive elements that may impact the efficacy of immunotherapy. Immunosenescence is increasingly regarded as a factor that contributes to cancer development, remodels the tumor microenvironment and affects the efficacy of immunotherapy. Natural products are at the forefront of traditional medicine. Senotherapeutics is a class of drugs and natural products capable of delaying, preventing, or reversing the senescence process (i.e., senolytics) or suppressing senescence-associated secretory phenotype (i.e., senomorphics). Emerging evidence supports that natural products can improve the efficacy of existing immunotherapy and expand their indications in GC mainly based upon remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment and reversing immunosenescence. The review provides an integrated review of previously reported and ongoing clinical trials with immunotherapeutic regimens in GC and discusses current challenges. Next, we focus on natural compounds that exert anti-GC functions and possess immunomodulatory properties. More attention is paid to the potential of these natural compounds in modulating the immune microenvironment and immunosenescence.
