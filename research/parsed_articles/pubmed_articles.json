    "title": "Mechanisms of aging-related secretory phenotype regulation in osteoporosis: Network regulation, trade-offs and homeostasis.",
    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is defined as a stable state of cell cycle arrest, characterized by the loss of proliferative capacity. This process can be triggered by diverse intracellular and extracellular stimuli. Senescent cells exhibit multiple hallmark features, including upregulation of cell cycle inhibitory proteins p16INK4a and p21Cip1, activation of DNA damage response, alterations in cellular architecture, and metabolic reprogramming. A prominent characteristic of senescent cells is their ability to secrete a heterogeneous array of bioactive molecules, collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These SASP components encompass cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and other signaling mediators that exert biological functions through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.With global population aging, osteoporosis has emerged as a critical public health challenge worldwide. Emerging evidence underscores the close association between osteoporosis and cellular senescence. During aging, the accumulation of senescent cells leads to enhanced SASP production, which contains pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators. These SASP factors not only propagate the senescence phenotype but also disrupt bone homeostasis by impairing the functionality of bone tissue cells, thereby accelerating skeletal aging. Recent advances highlight SASP as a promising therapeutic target for bone metabolic disorders such as osteoporosis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which SASP regulates bone cell populations remain incompletely elucidated.Addressing this knowledge gap, the present study aims to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of SASP in bone tissue cells, with the ultimate goal of providing mechanistic insights for developing novel strategies against age-related bone metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process marked by a progressive decline in cellular function, leading to age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Despite significant advancements in aging research, finding effective interventions to decelerate aging remains a challenge. This review explores microgravity as a novel therapeutic approach to combat aging and promote healthy longevity. The hallmarks of aging, including genomic instability, telomere shortening, and cellular senescence, form the basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind aging. Interestingly, microgravity has been shown to accelerate aging-like processes in model organisms and human tissues, making it an ideal environment for studying aging mechanisms in an accelerated manner. Spaceflight studies, such as NASA's Twins Study and experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), reveal striking parallels between the physiological changes induced by microgravity and those observed in aging populations, including muscle atrophy, bone density loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, and immune system decline in a microgravity environment. However, upon microgravity recovery, cellular behavior, gene expression, and tissue regeneration were seen, providing vital insights into aging mechanisms and prospective therapeutic approaches. This review examines the potential of microgravity-based technologies to pioneer novel strategies for decelerating aging and enhancing healthspan under natural gravity, paving the way for breakthroughs in longevity therapies.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a complex process that significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. It is characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest and morphological changes, such as cell enlargement and a decrease in lamin B levels. As organisms age, a secretory phenotype known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) develops, which produces pro-inflammatory factors that can impact surrounding tissues and promote disease. This article discusses the molecular mechanisms regulating senescence, notably the p53/p21 and p16INK4a/pRb pathways, which are crucial for inducing cell cycle arrest. While increased activity of cyclin inhibitors like p16 and p21 serves as a protective mechanism against cancer, their prolonged activation can lead to pathological effects. Additionally, the article examines therapies involving senolytics and senomorphics, which aim to eliminate senescent cells. Current research suggests that targeting senescence may represent a promising strategy for treating various diseases, improving health outcomes, and enhancing the overall quality of life as we age.",

It has been proven that telomere shortening and telomerase abnormalities are related to the occurrence and development of ILD. Telomere shortening occurs in different types of ILD patients and is associated with prognosis. Gene therapy targeting telomerase exhibits therapeutic potential.

    "abstract": "The angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), also known as fasting-induced adipose factor, is a secreted glycoprotein that belongs to the ANGPTL protein family. Due to its expression in various cell types and tissues and its interactions with other proteins, ANGPTL4 plays diverse roles within its family, exhibiting a wider range of molecular functions.Â For instance, ANGPTL4 is intricately involved in modulating central energy metabolism and enhancing exercise endurance, while also acting as a pivotal mediator in the interaction between gut microbiota and host lipid metabolism. Moreover, the expression of ANGPTL4 is directly controlled by aging-related signaling pathways. Its excessive activation accelerates the aging process by triggering mechanisms like heightened oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis, abnormal lipid accumulation, and cellular arrest, thereby advancing the development of age-related diseases. Given the pivotal roles of ANGPTL4 and its associated molecules in organ fibrosis and cancer advancement, targeting ANGPTL4 emerges as a promising therapeutic approach. However, the intricate and sometimes conflicting functions of the two cleavage fragments of ANGPTL4, namely N-terminal fragment (nANGPTL4) and C-terminal fragment (cANGPTL4), in different chronic diseases-exerting inhibitory or stimulatory effects depending on the disease stage-have posed challenges to the progress of ANGPTL4 antibody therapy. This review provides an overview of the biological mechanisms of ANGPTL4, its dual impact on fibrosis and tumorigenesis, and highlights its recent advancements as a potential biomarker in age-related diseases and inflammation-related conditions. ANGPTL4 is a high-potential but complex target, requiring mechanism-driven strategies for safe clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) has emerged as a promising vertebrate model for aging research because of its unique characteristics. Its exceptionally short lifespan and rapid aging make it an ideal model for studying age-related phenomena in compressed timeframes. This species exhibits hallmarks of aging observed in longer-lived vertebrates, including motor neuron degeneration, muscle weakness, and impaired regenerative capacity. These features make it valuable for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms of age-related diseases and tissue regeneration. However, current research has primarily focused on brain aging and neurodegeneration, while systemic age-related changes across organs remain underexplored. The impact of aging on tissue regeneration in this model needs comprehensive investigation. This review summarizes current research using African turquoise killifish on age-related diseases and tissue regeneration in multiple organs. By integrating aging and regeneration biology, this review offers a perspective that expands the utility of this species beyond neurobiology, positioning it as a promising model for gerontology and regenerative medicine. We discuss limitations and future directions to advance its use in aging studies across multiple organs. Future research on African turquoise killifish will contribute to identifying therapeutic targets and developing interventions for age-related diseases, ultimately extending healthy life expectancy in humans.",

I critically examine two main groups of ageing theories: error-based and program-based theories. I discuss the relevance of these theories in the context of ageing patterns, genetic manipulations and longevity drugs, highlighting how experimental challenges and technological limitations have hindered progress. Overall, there is a pressing and unmet need for a robust theoretical framework in ageing research.

    "abstract": "Aging features a gradual decline in genomic integrity, epigenetic fidelity, and cellular homeostasis, driving the onset of chronic pathologies such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disease. Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha (GADD45Î±) functions as a pivotal stress-response mediator, coordinating DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, oxidative stress defence, mitochondrial quality control, and chromatin remodeling. Researchers have extensively studied GADD45Î± in tumor suppression, but its roles in healthy aging and age-related disorders remain underexplored. Here, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of recent findings illuminating GADD45Î±'s contributions to aging biology. We detail its engagement with nucleotide and base excision repair pathways to preserve genome stability, enforce Gâ/M checkpoints to prevent damaged DNA propagation, and promote mitochondrial resilience under oxidative challenge. We then examine how GADD45Î± modulates epigenetic landscapes, mitigating age-associated DNA methylation drift and sustaining chromatin plasticity, and highlight its emerging neuroprotective actions in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's models. Integrating multi-omics analyses, in vivo rodent investigations, and Drosophila lifespan assays, we establish GADD45Î± as a dynamic biomarker of cellular aging and a promising geroprotective target. Finally, we discuss translational strategies to harness GADD45Î± activity, ranging from small-molecule enhancers and epigenetic modifiers to precision gene-editing to reinforce DNA repair capacity, delay senescence onset, and extend organismal healthspan. This review reframes GADD45Î± from a cancer-centric effector to a versatile regulator of aging processes, underscoring its therapeutic potential for promoting healthy longevity.",

    "abstract": "The elderly and astronauts exhibit strikingly similar phenotypes. Although much research has addressed the comparison between these two groups at the level of the whole organism or organ level, like the musculoskeletal system, comparative studies at the cellular level remain limited. Therefore, this article aims to address this gap by conducting an extensive scoping review, comparing cell function and alterations with advanced age to those observed in altered gravity. The broad review spans different cell types and species, highlighting the generic nature of aging and its relationship to gravity. We identified 165 signs of aging at the cell level, deducted from leading aging papers, and grouped them into 11 themes: DNA and epigenetics, mitochondria, nucleus, immune system, protein and metabolism, lysosome and degradation, cell cycle, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix (ECM), cell mechanics, and cell signaling. Following this classification, we conducted a comprehensive search using the databases Web of Science and PubMed to examine the behavior of these signs in altered gravity conditions. The results reveal that only 29% of the responses are similar in (simulated) microgravity compared to biological aging, while others show contrasting behavior, thereby highlighting the complexity of cellular responses in these conditions. However, the majority of the signs remain unexplored in altered gravity. Mechanotransduction emerges as a potential key player in the observed phenotypic resemblances between aging and microgravity. Since there still is quite a lack of knowledge of aging-related effects on a cellular level in gravity-related research, we recommend further gravity research on the many components making up the links that facilitate mechanotransduction, which can aid in understanding the origins of these shared phenotypes and could lead to new insights into age-related and space-induced health challenges.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a fundamental mechanism in aging, marked by irreversible growth arrest and diverse functional changes, including, but not limited to, the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). While transient senescence contributes to beneficial processes such as tissue repair and tumor suppression, the persistent accumulation of senescent cells is implicated in tissue dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and age-related diseases. Notably, the SASP can exert both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, depending on cell type, tissue context, and temporal dynamics, particularly in early stages where it may be profibrotic and immunomodulatory. Recent advances in senotherapeutics have led to two principal strategies for targeting senescent cells: senolytics, which selectively induce their apoptosis, and senomorphics, which modulate deleterious aspects of the senescence phenotype, including the SASP, without removing the cells. This review critically examines the molecular mechanisms, therapeutic agents, and clinical potential of both approaches in the context of anti-aging interventions. We discuss major classes of senolytics, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, BCL-2 family inhibitors, and natural polyphenols, alongside senomorphics including mTOR and JAK inhibitors, rapalogs, and epigenetic modulators. Additionally, we explore the biological heterogeneity of senescent cells, challenges in developing specific biomarkers, and the dualistic role of senescence in physiological versus pathological states. The review also highlights emerging tools, such as targeted delivery systems, multi-omics integration, and AI-assisted drug discovery, which are advancing precision geroscience and shaping future anti-aging strategies.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a significant contributor to numerous diseases and presents serious challenges to public health. Consequently, investigating the underlying mechanisms of aging and developing effective interventions to combat its effects have become increasingly important, as achieving healthy aging has emerged as a growing priority. A primary characteristic of aging is the epigenetic changes that occur within the genome. Epigenetic regulation, functioning as a reversible mechanism, closely links gene composition to phenotype and plays a crucial role in reversing aging in response to environmental stimuli. Epigenetics involves modifying phenotype or gene expression by regulating posttranscriptional levels without altering the DNA sequence. These mechanisms are vital to the aging process and are anticipated to become key targets for delaying aging and improving or preventing age-related diseases in the future. Recent studies have indicated that natural product therapy has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for mitigating the effects of aging. The application of natural products acting via the epigenetic regulation in therapy is particularly flexible and controllable, facilitating practical use while reducing the risk of drug resistance and enhancing host immune responses. This article reviews the current research status and advancements in epigenetic pathways within the realm of anti-aging drugs, proposing future research directions and potential development trends.

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a normal response to age-related exposures. According to the thermodynamic hypothesis of protein folding, soluble proteins precipitate into amyloids (pathology) under supersaturated conditions through a process similar to crystallization. This soluble-to-insoluble phase transition occurs via nucleation and may be catalyzed by ectopic surfaces such as lipid nanoparticles, microbes, or chemical pollutants. The increasing prevalence of these exposures with age correlates with the rising incidence of pathology over the lifespan. However, the formation of amyloid fibrils does not inherently cause neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration emerges when the levels of functional monomeric proteins, from which amyloids form, fall below a critical threshold. The preservation of monomeric proteins may explain neurological resilience, regardless of the extent of amyloid deposition. This biophysical framework challenges the traditional clinicopathological view that considers amyloids intrinsically toxic, despite the absence of a known mechanism of toxicity. Instead, it suggests that chronic exposures driving persistent nucleation consume monomeric proteins as they aggregate. In normal aging, replacement matches loss; in accelerated aging, it does not. A biophysical approach to neurodegenerative diseases has important therapeutic implications, refocusing treatment strategies from removing pathology to restoring monomeric protein homeostasis above the threshold needed to sustain normal brain function.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a systemic process marked by progressive multi-organ dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation, and chronic low-grade inflammation (\"inflammaging\"), which collectively drive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Emerging evidence underscores the brain-muscle-liver axis as a central hub for maintaining energy homeostasis and neuroimmune crosstalk during aging. Here, we elucidate how exercise orchestrates inter-organ communication to counteract age-related decline through metabolic reprogramming, immunomodulation, and neuroprotection. Mechanistically, exercise enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle via AMPK/PGC-1Î± signaling, restoring fatty acid oxidation and glucose metabolism while producing myokines (e.g., BDNF and IL-6) that promote neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Concurrently, hepatic SIRT1 activation promotes lipid metabolism, mitigates insulin resistance, and reduces systemic inflammation, hence preserving brain energy supply. In the aging brain, exercise stimulates neurogenesis, suppresses neuroinflammation via NF-ÎºB inhibition, and elevates BDNF levels, which synergistically enhance cognitive resilience. vitally, exercise modulates the neuro-immunometabolic axis by balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6's hormetic role), optimizing immune cell function, and enhancing autophagy-mediated clearance of toxic aggregates (AÎ², Î±-synuclein). These adaptations are further amplified by epigenetic reprogramming, including but not limited to Nrf2-driven antioxidant responses and circadian rhythm synchronization. Our synthesis highlights exercise as a pleiotropic intervention that transcends single-organ influences, instead leveraging multi-tissue networks to delay aging and neurodegeneration. Unresolved challenges-personalized exercise regimens, molecular biomarkers for efficacy prediction, and combinatorial therapies with pharmacologic agents-underscore the need for translational studies integrating omics technologies and circadian biology.

Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) that are found in plasma have emerged as promising candidates, especially for biomarker studies on neurodegenerative diseases because they are reachable and comparable with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. In addition to known proteins, synaptic proteins, transcription factors, or microRNAs have been suggested as new biomarkers, aiming to help differential or early diagnosis. Beyond their involvement in AD pathology, NDEVs also play essential roles in neurodevelopment and aging by mediating cell-to-cell communication and regulating processes such as synaptic formation, neuronal differentiation, and neuroinflammation. Age-related alterations in EV composition and secretion may contribute to the decline in neuroplasticity, thereby increasing susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Several challenges such as heterogeneous isolation of NDEVs limit the widespread clinical application of them as biomarkers for AD. Furthermore, the lack of standardized protocols for vesicle isolation and molecular analysis poses a barrier to reproducibility and clinical validation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role of NDEVs in AD pathogenesis in comparison with their functions in neurodevelopment and aging, evaluate their potential as biomarkers for early diagnosis, while addressing the challenges in their isolation, characterization, and clinical application.",

    "title": "Targeting Senescence, Oxidative Stress, and Inflammation: Quercetin-Based Strategies for Ocular Diseases in Older Adults.",
    "abstract": "Quercetin, a flavonol abundant in fruits and vegetables, has attracted significant attention for its senotherapeutic effects, which involve the selective elimination of senescent cells and the modulation of pro-inflammatory phenotypes that contribute to age-related dysfunctions. These actions, together with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-angiogenic properties, make quercetin a promising strategy for ocular diseases associated with visual impairment in older adults such as age-related macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. This review emphasizes the mechanisms by which quercetin exerts its protective effects, with particular attention to its ability to target cellular senescence, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate inflammation. Despite extensive preclinical evidence, the clinical application of quercetin remains limited due to challenges related to poor bioavailability, rapid degradation, and the absence of standardized ocular formulations. Progress in drug delivery systems, including nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and solid lipid carriers, provides promising strategies to overcome these barriers. In addition, combining quercetin with established treatments, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and neuroprotective drugs, may enhance its therapeutic potential in managing and possibly reversing age-related ophthalmic disorders.",

RNA therapeutics constitute an emerging approach to target the molecular mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases via rational design and have several advantages over traditional drug therapies, including high specificity, low toxicity and the potential for rapid development and production. Here, we discuss the latest developments in RNA therapeutics designed to promote healthy aging, including RNA activation, messenger RNA therapy, RNA interference, antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers and CRISPR-Cas-mediated RNA editing. We also review the latest preclinical and clinical studies of RNA technology for treating age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases. Finally, we discuss the challenges of RNA technology aimed at supporting healthy aging.

    "abstract": "Aging is a natural biological process influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors such as genetics, environment, and individual lifestyle. The aging-dependent decline in resting and maximum heart rate is a conserved feature across multiple species, including humans. Such changes in heart rhythm control underscore fundamental alterations in the primary cardiac pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (SAN). Older individuals often present symptoms of SAN dysfunction (SND), including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, and bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. These can lead to a broad range of symptoms from palpitations, dizziness to recurrent syncope. The sharp rise in the incidence of SND among individuals over 65 years old, coupled with projected longevity over the next decades, highlights the urgent need for a deeper mechanistic understanding of aging-related SND to develop novel and effective therapeutic alternatives. In this review, we will revisit current knowledge on the ionic and structural remodeling underlying age-related decline in SAN function, and a particular emphasis will be made on new directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which there is currently no cure, and its incidence is on the rise. Early detection is essential for timely intervention and slowing the progression of the disease. While the brain structures of healthy aging individuals change gradually, the aging trajectories in AD patients deviate significantly. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the detection of subtle changes in brain structures using neuroimaging data. By developing brain age prediction models based on data from healthy individuals, it is possible to estimate brain age at various stages of AD progression and assess the Brain Age Gap (BAG)-the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age-which holds promise as an early diagnostic biomarker for AD. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, for brain age prediction has attracted considerable attention. This systematic review provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of research in this field, focusing on the progress and limitations of machine learning techniques for brain age prediction. We place particular emphasis on deep learning methods, addressing data sources, model development, and interpretability. Additionally, we analyze key challenges in the field, including site effects, bias correction, insufficient data, hardware requirements, model accuracy, and clinical applicability. Finally, we offer insights and recommendations for future research directions to address these challenges and further enhance the potential of BAG as a diagnostic tool for AD.",

    "title": "The impact of aging and biological sex on cardiac collagen metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Age and sex exert profound influences on the heart, shaping its structure, function, and susceptibility to disease. Among the myriad of changes driven by age and sex, alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly collagen influence myocardial health in aging. Collagen, the predominant ECM protein, upholds tissue integrity and function through tightly regulated processes. Aging, a significant cardiovascular risk factor, is linked to increased collagen deposition, left ventricular remodelling, and fibrosis. Similarly, sex differences affect cardiovascular disease progression, with notable variations in the deposition of collagen types I and III between males and females. While collagen accumulation is present in aging in both sexes, females exhibit a tempered response until menopause, primarily due to oestrogen-mediated suppression of excessive collagen remodelling. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying age- and sex-related changes in cardiac collagen metabolism and their implications for myocardial health. Aging-associated fibrosis and collagen accumulation appear mechanistically distinct from those seen with injury or dysfunction, occurring without increased collagen synthesis despite elevated degradation enzymes. Factors such as senescence, inflammation, oxidative stress, and enhanced ECM crosslinking are identified as key drivers of these metabolic shifts. While studies in ovariectomized rodent models have highlighted the role of sex in collagen metabolism, evidence suggests that aging exerts a more dominant influence overall. Additionally, this review emphasizes a critical gap in the field: the limited availability of longitudinal aging fibrosis studies that include both sexes. This scarcity hampers a comprehensive understanding of how aging and sex collectively shape collagen turnover and myocardial health. By assessing these knowledge gaps, the review aims to define current perspectives and may provide insights to help inform the development of more effective, targeted therapeutic approaches.",

Interestingly, an attractive mechanism involving liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) may exert a central role in regulating heterochromatin formation and maintenance. In this review, we provide an overview of recent research to illustrate the role and regulatory mechanism of the biomolecular condensates in the regulation of heterochromatin stabilization. In addition, we elucidate how heterochromatin loss contributes to cellular senescence by triggering genome instability, and explore the potential therapeutic strategies to counteract cellular senescence and age-related pathologies by restoring heterochromatin stability. Finally, we outline current research challenges and future directions aimed at achieving a more comprehensive understanding of the link among heterochromatin regulation, phase separation, and cellular senescence, for ameliorating the effects of ageing in the future.",

    "title": "\"Aging and epigenetic implications in radiotherapy: The promise of BNCT\".",
    "abstract": "Although cancer treatment strategies have made considerable progress in recent decades, the challenge of selectively killing tumor cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue remains. Radiotherapy (RT) continues to be crucial for tumor growth control when combined with surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. RT effectiveness depends on factors such as cancer type, tumor features, and the choice of external or internal treatment. Given its non-invasive nature and low systemic toxicity, RT is a suitable strategy for elderly patients. However, despite its efficacy, variations in cell sensitivity to radiation influence treatment outcomes, and normal cells surrounding the tumor can also be affected. Radiation-induced DNA damage can trigger cellular senescence, a permanent cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, contributing to tissue damage in healthy cells and radio-resistance in tumor cells. RT causes not only DNA breakage but also epigenetic remodeling. Epigenetic pathways are involved in RT response, and the radiosensitivity of tumor cells can be modulated using epigenetic compounds. Emerging treatments based on more precise forms of RT, such as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), offer promising results by selectively targeting tumors while potentially preserving healthy tissues. BNCT has shown efficacy in glioblastoma, recurrent head and neck carcinoma, and melanoma. This review i) examines the mechanisms and challenges of conventional RT, focusing on aging and its role in treatment efficacy and tolerability, ii) describes the impact of senescence and epigenetic factors on resistance, iii) explores advances in BNCT, and iv) considers the potential of epigenetic drugs to optimize RT outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia a progressive and multifactorial musculoskeletal syndrome characterized by loss of muscle mass and function, poses a significant global health challenge, particularly in aging populations. Epidemiological studies reveal that sarcopenia affects approximately 5-10% of the general population, with prevalence rates escalating dramatically after age 60 to reach 10-27% in older adults. This age-associated increase contributes significantly to healthcare burdens by elevating risks of disability, frailty, and mortality. Despite its profound impact, current clinical approaches to sarcopenia remain limited. While resistance exercise and protein supplementation form the cornerstone of management, their efficacy is often constrained by poor long-term adherence and variable individual responses, highlighting the urgent need for more comprehensive and personalized treatment strategies. The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and influenced by various factors, including aging, inflammation, nutritional deficits, physical inactivity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this condition are still not fully understood. Recent research has made significant strides in elucidating the intricate mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia, revealing novel insights into its molecular and cellular underpinnings. Notably, emerging evidence points to the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction, altered myokine profiles, and neuromuscular junction degeneration in sarcopenia progression. Additionally, breakthroughs in stem cell therapy, exosome-based treatments, and precision nutrition offer promising avenues for clinical intervention. This review aims to synthesize the latest advancements in sarcopenia research, focusing on the novel contributions to its pathogenesis and treatment strategies. We explore emerging trends such as the role of cellular senescence, epigenetic regulation, and targeted therapeutic interventions that could reshape future approaches to managing sarcopenia. By highlighting recent breakthroughs and cutting-edge research, we hope to advance the understanding of sarcopenia and foster the translation of these findings into effective clinical therapies.",

This review systematically summarizes recent discoveries on how MSCs counteract immune aging, particularly their ability to rejuvenate aged immune cells and restore immune homeostasis. It also addresses key challenges, such as variations in MSC sources, donor variability, and the lack of standardized protocols, while proposing future directions to enhance therapeutic precision.

Severe COVID-19 infection was reported to be associated with altered immunometabolism and cytokine storms, contributing to poor clinical outcomes and in many cases resulting in mortality. Despite promising preclinical results, many drugs have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials, highlighting the need for novel approaches to combat the virus and its severe manifestations. Mitochondria, crucial for aerobic respiration, play a pivotal role in modulating immunometabolism and neuronal function, making their compromised capability as central pathological mechanism contributing to the development of neurological complications in COVID-19. Dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics can lead to uncontrolled immune responses, underscoring the importance of mitochondrial regulation in shaping clinical outcomes. Aging further accelerates mitochondrial dysfunction, compounding immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, making older adults particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae. COVID-19 infection impairs mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to the long-term neurological complications associated with the disease. Additionally, recent reports also suggest that up to 30% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering neurological issues, thereby highlighting the critical need for further research into mitochondrial pathways to mitigate long-tern neurological consequences of Covid-19. This review examines the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID-19-induced neurological complications, its connection to aging, and potential biomarkers for clinical diagnostics.

In the tumor microenvironment, senescent T cells lead to the inability of tumor cells to be effectively eliminated, triggering immunosuppression, which in turn affects the efficacy of immunotherapy. This is a strong indication that T-cell senescence significantly weakens the immune function of the body, making individuals, especially elderly patients with cancer, more vulnerable to cancer attacks. Despite the many challenges, T-cell senescence is important as a potential therapeutic target. This review provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of T-cell senescence and its research advances in patients with cancer, especially in older adults, and systematically analyzes potential intervention strategies, including molecular mechanism-based interventions, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T cell therapy. It is hoped that this will establish a theoretical framework for T-cell senescence in the field of tumor immunology and provide a scientific and prospective reference basis for subsequent in-depth research and clinical practice on senescent T cells.",

    "title": "Unraveling immunosenescence in sepsis: from cellular mechanisms to therapeutics.",
    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening multiple organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, and patients with sepsis always exhibit a state of immune disorder characterized by both overwhelming inflammation and immunosuppression. The aging of immune system, namely \"immunosenescence\", has been reported to be correlated with high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with sepsis. Initially, immunosenescence was considered as a range of age-related alterations in the immune system. However, increasing evidence has proven that persistent inflammation or even a short-term inflammatory challenge during sepsis could trigger accelerated aging of immune cells, which might further exacerbate inflammatory cytokine storm and promote the shift towards immunosuppression. Thus, premature immunosenescence is found in young sepsis individuals, which further aggravates immune disorders and induces the progression of sepsis. Furthermore, in old sepsis patients, the synergistic effects of both sepsis and aging may cause immunosenescence-associated alterations more significantly, resulting in more severe immune dysfunction and a worse prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the potential therapeutic strategies targeting immunosenescence during sepsis.",

    "title": "In vitro senescence and senolytic functional assays.",
    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of aging biology and the development of anti-aging therapeutic strategies remain imperative yet inherently challenging due to the protracted nature of aging. Cellular senescence arises naturally through replicative exhaustion and is accelerated by clinical treatments or environmental stressors. The accumulation of senescent cells-defined by a loss of mitogenic potential, resistance to apoptosis, and acquisition of a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype-has been implicated as a key driver of chronic disease, tissue degeneration, and organismal aging. Recent studies have highlighted the therapeutic promise of senolytic drugs, which selectively eliminate senescent cells. Compelling results from preclinical animal studies and ongoing clinical trials underscore this potential. However, the clinical translation of senolytics requires further pharmacological validation to refine selectivity, minimize toxicity, and determine optimal dosing. Equally important is the evaluation of senolytics' potential to restore tissue structure and function by reducing the senescent cell burden. In vitro tissue culture models offer a powerful platform to advance these efforts. This review summarizes the current landscape of in vitro systems used for inducing cellular senescence-referred to as \"senescence assays\"-and for screening senolytic drugs-referred to as \"senolytic assays\". We conclude by discussing key challenges to improving mechanistic insight, predictive accuracy, and clinical relevance in senolytic drug development, as well as emerging applications of senolytic therapies.",

However, its usability can be hindered by age-related sensory, motor, and cognitive changes, which may contribute to anxiety, disorientation, and reduced task engagement. In this narrative review, we examine the challenges older adults face with IVR and explore strategies to optimize its design for this population. These challenges include negative attitudes, sensory and motor limitations, and cognitive decline, all of which influence interaction with virtual environments. Based on these insights, we discuss design considerations such as self-paced interactions, simplified control mechanisms, task-relevant visual and auditory adjustments, and structured training protocols to enhance engagement. Additionally, we highlight strategies to minimize cognitive load and physical discomfort, supporting the development of IVR applications that are both effective and accessible for aging populations.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac aging involves progressive structural, functional, cellular, and molecular changes that impair heart function. This review explores key mechanisms, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage heart muscle cells, contributing to fibrosis and cellular aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces energy production and increases oxidative stress, accelerating cardiac decline. Impaired autophagy limits the removal of damaged proteins and organelles, while inflammation activates signaling molecules that drive tissue remodeling. Gender differences reveal estrogen's protective role in premenopausal women, with men showing greater susceptibility to heart muscle dysfunction and injury. After menopause, women lose this hormonal protection, increasing their risk of cardiovascular conditions. Ethnic disparities, particularly among underserved minority populations, emphasize how social factors such as access to care, environment, and chronic stress contribute to worsening cardiovascular outcomes. The coronavirus disease pandemic has introduced further challenges by increasing the incidence of heart damage through inflammation, blood clots, and long-term heart failure, especially in older adults with existing metabolic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. The virus's interaction with receptors on heart and blood vessel cells, along with a weakened immune response in older adults, intensifies cardiac aging. Emerging therapies include delivery of therapeutic extracellular vesicles, immune cell modulation, and treatments targeting mitochondria. In addition, lifestyle strategies such as regular physical activity, nutritional improvements, and stress reduction remain vital to maintaining cardiac health. Understanding how these biological and social factors intersect is critical to developing targeted strategies that promote healthy aging of the heart.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a multifaceted biological process marked by a gradual decline in physiological functions, driven by cellular senescence, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and stem cell exhaustion. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), naturally occurring nanoscale vesicles secreted by various cell types, have gained attention as potential therapeutic agents due to their ability to mediate intercellular communication by delivering bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and RNAs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of EV biogenesis, cargo composition, and their mechanistic roles in counteracting aging processes. EVs from diverse sources-such as mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, dermal fibroblasts, and colostrum-exhibit regenerative properties by modulating immune responses, enhancing tissue repair, and promoting extracellular matrix homeostasis. Recent preclinical and clinical studies further highlight their potential in addressing age-related diseases and skin rejuvenation. However, significant challenges remain, including standardization of EV production, large-scale manufacturing, safety profiling, and regulatory approval. By leveraging advancements in EV engineering, targeted delivery systems, and combination strategies with existing anti-aging interventions, EV-based therapies hold promise as next-generation approaches in regenerative medicine and longevity enhancement.",

We discuss innovations in tissue engineering, such as the use of scaffolds or bioprinting to generate functional tissues, methods for enhancing donor-recipient compatibility through genetic engineering and recent progress in both cell therapies and xenotransplantation strategies. We explore synthetic approaches including prostheses, external devices and brain-machine interfaces. Additionally, we evaluate the evidence from heterochronic parabiosis experiments in mice and donor-recipient age-mismatched transplants to consider whether systemic benefits could result from personalized replacement approaches. Finally, we outline key challenges and future directions required to advance replacement therapies as viable, scalable and ethical interventions for aging.",

The mnemonic \"King/A+++/HermÃ¨s\" aids in recalling the pathophysiology of aging-related hypertension. Accurate blood pressure measurements are important to determine the prognosis and treatment in the elderly; however, obtaining reliable measurement data in this population is not always easy, as changes in cardiovascular structure and hemodynamics with aging may lead to increased blood pressure variability. In the second part of this review, we evaluate the effectiveness of blood pressure monitoring in older adults, emphasizing the importance of precise measurements. We also assess the efficacy of home and ambulatory monitoring, discuss orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic hypertension, outline challenges in measuring blood pressure in individuals with atrial fibrillation, and explore the impact of aging on measurement errors. We conclude that understanding the interplay between hypertension and aging, coupled with precise blood pressure monitoring strategies tailored for older adults, is essential for effective management and to improve overall cardiovascular health in the elderly population.",

Among the most influential are Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which aims to counteract biological decline through targeted damage repair, and the Hallmarks of Aging (HoA), which seeks to identify fundamental mechanisms underlying this process. Both proposals, although diverse, significantly influence contemporary approaches to the challenges posed by aging. However, despite extensive discussion, we contend that key conceptual and methodological aspects remain insufficiently explored. This paper seeks to advance the debate by critically analyzing and comparing their foundational goals, theoretical premises, and research frameworks. Specifically, we examine their definitions of aging, perspectives on health and disease, approaches to scientific evidence and causal interventions, and communications strategies. In doing so, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding and more nuanced assessment of both SENS and the HoA.",

Aging is a complex, multifactorial process shaped by many factors including genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors.

However, emerging evidence suggests that telomere dynamic is not inevitable but can be influenced by oxidative stress, lifestyle choices, and metabolic regulation. This review examines how telomere-based biomarkers and metabolic interventions can drive personalized longevity medicine, enabling targeted strategies to delay aging.

However, the specific mechanism of CS in AD remains unclear. This article reviews AD pathogenesis, the mechanisms associated with CS in AD, and the CS-based therapeutic drugs for AD including chemical agents and traditional Chinese medicine. Based on this, this review also summarized the clinical feasibility and challenges of CS-based therapies and aims to provide novel insights for developing effective therapeutic strategies against AD.

    "abstract": "Epidemiological research reveals that around 40Â % of women aged 18-59 report significant concerns about their sexual experiences. Endothelial function and proper arterial blood flow through the hypogastric and pudendal arteries are critical in women for a normal vasculogenic response to sexual stimulation. Organic causes of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) often stem from neuropathy or vascular complications linked to cardiovascular risk factors. The relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and FSD is multifactorial, influenced by various factors such as disease severity, physical and physiological factors, social determinants and factors related to medication use. Additionally, the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in FSD of CVD patients include vascular, physical, psychological and hormonal factors. Hypertension, stroke, and myocardial infarction are closely interrelated with FSD, which is not the case for coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, and peripheral obstructive artery disease. Hormonal treatment for sexual dysfunction in women with cardiovascular risk factors is discussed, concerning menopausal hormone therapy, tibolone, selective estrogen receptor modulators, vaginal estrogen, prasterone and testosterone therapy. On the other hand, the beneficial effect of sexual activity on cardiovascular health has been gaining supportive evidence. In healthy postmenopausal women aged 45-60, penile-vaginal intercourse has been suggested to positively influence cardiac autonomic functions, as indicated by heart rate variability. However, effectively addressing the challenges of aging and further highlighting the positive impact of sexual activity on cardiac health in selected female populations could significantly enhance life motivation and promote a healthy lifestyle during this stage.

    "abstract": "A significant increase in life expectancy worldwide has resulted in a growing aging population, accompanied by a rise in aging-related diseases that pose substantial societal, economic, and medical challenges. This trend has prompted extensive efforts within many scientific and medical communities to develop and enhance therapies aimed at delaying aging processes, mitigating aging-related functional decline, and addressing aging-associated diseases to extend health span. Research in aging biology has focused on unraveling various biochemical and genetic pathways contributing to aging-related changes, including genomic instability, telomere shortening, and cellular senescence. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived through reprogramming human somatic cells, has revolutionized disease modeling and understanding in humans by addressing the limitations of conventional animal models and primary human cells. iPSCs offer significant advantages over other pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells, as they can be obtained without the need for embryo destruction and are not restricted by the availability of healthy donors or patients. These attributes position iPSC technology as a promising avenue for modeling and deciphering mechanisms that underlie aging and associated diseases, as well as for studying drug effects. Moreover, iPSCs exhibit remarkable versatility in differentiating into diverse cell types, making them a promising tool for personalized regenerative therapies aimed at replacing aged or damaged cells with healthy, functional equivalents.

In young organisms, it acts as a barrier against tumorigenesis, but in the aging population, it may facilitate tumor growth and metastasis through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in the immune system, particularly in the surveillance, targeting, and elimination of malignant and senescent cells. However, age-related immunosenescence is characterized by declining NK cell function resulting in diminished ability to fight infection, eliminate senescent cells and suppress tumor development. This implies that preserving or augmenting NK cell function may be central to defense against age-related degenerative and malignant diseases. This review explores the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions, focusing on how aging influences the battle between the immune system and cancer, the implications of senescent NK cells in disease progression, and the potential of adoptive NK cell therapy as a countermeasure to these age-related immunological challenges.",

In the context of aging, multiple factors lead to the release of endogenous DNA (especially mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA), which is an important trigger for the activation of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway. Recent studies have identified an increasing role for activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway as a driver of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) in aging and NDDs. The cGAS-STING pathway mediates the immune sensing of DNA and is a key driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during the aging process. Blocking cGAS-STING signaling may reduce the inflammatory response by preventing mtDNA release and enhancing mitophagy. Targeted inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway by biological macromolecules such as natural products shows promise in therapeutic strategies for age-related NDDs. This review aims to systematically and comprehensively introduces the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in age-related NDDs in the context of aging while revealing the molecular mechanisms of the cGAS-STING pathway and its downstream signaling pathways and to develop more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies for NDDs.",

With different animal models, from invertebrates to mammals, research into the biology of ageing has identified various biological and physiological processes that alter the quality of ageing. Twelve characteristics of ageing have been defined, and the aim of a growing number of studies is to find how to slow down or halt their onset. Unfortunately, the direct transposition of animal models to humans is too often disappointing, and the race to bring anti-ageing products to market is a source of misleading promises. The development of geroscience will enable the identification and validation, with more relevant clinical evidence, of pro-ageing targets to develop anti-ageing therapies and aim for healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac aging represents a complex pathophysiological process characterized by progressive metabolic recombination and functional dedifferentiation of cardiac cellular components. Despite advancements in cardiovascular medicine, a critical research gap persists in understanding the precise epigenetic mechanisms that drive age-related cardiac dysfunction. This comprehensive review elucidates the pivotal role of histone modifications-including methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation-in orchestrating the molecular landscape of cardiac aging. Significant gaps remain in our understanding of site-specific histone modification impacts on cardiac function, the intricate crosstalk between different histone marks, and their integration with metabolic alterations that characterize the aging myocardium. Current evidence reveals a dynamic epigenetic signature in aged cardiac tissue, typically featuring increased transcriptional activation markers alongside decreased repressive marks, though context-dependent variations exist. This review explores how histone modifications influence critical pathways governing mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage repair, inflammation, and fibrosis in aging hearts. Innovative therapeutic approaches targeting specific histone-modifying enzymes promise to mitigate age-related cardiac deterioration, potentially revolutionizing treatment paradigms for cardiovascular diseases in aging populations. Addressing these knowledge gaps requires multidimensional approaches that integrate epigenomics with functional assessment of cardiac performance.",

Understanding the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced CVD is essential for developing targeted therapies to mitigate these effects and improve long-term outcomes for patients with cancer. Recent Advances: Recent studies have primarily focused on metabolic alterations induced by irradiation in various cancer cell types. However, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the role of chronic metabolic alterations in normal cells, particularly vascular cells, in the progression of CVD after RT. Critical Issues: This review centers on RT-induced metabolic alterations in vascular cells and their contribution to senescence accumulation and chronic inflammation across the vasculature post-RT. We discuss key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid metabolism, glutamine metabolism, and redox metabolism (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)/NADPH). We further explore the roles of regulatory proteins such as p53, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin in driving these metabolic dysregulations. The review emphasizes the impact of immune-vascular crosstalk mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which perpetuates metabolic dysfunction, enhances chronic inflammation, drives senescence accumulation, and causes vascular damage, ultimately contributing to cardiovascular pathogenesis. Future Directions: Future research should prioritize identifying therapeutic targets within these metabolic pathways or the immune-vascular interactions influenced by RT. Correcting metabolic dysfunction and reducing chronic inflammation through targeted therapies could significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes in cancer survivors. Antioxid.

CKD exacerbates sarcopenia through complex molecular and cellular mechanisms, including chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, uremic toxin accumulation, protein-energy wasting, and hormonal dysregulation. This review explores the interplay between CKD and sarcopenia, focusing on key pathways such as mTOR signaling, the AMPK-FOXO axis, and myostatin/activin pathways that regulate muscle protein metabolism. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired autophagy emerge as critical contributors to muscle wasting. Clinical implications include identifying biomarkers such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, myostatin, and Klotho for diagnosis and monitoring, while potential therapeutic strategies involve targeting the AMPK/mTOR pathway, enhancing mitochondrial function, and inhibiting myostatin activity. Emerging approaches, including multi-omics technologies and AI-driven personalized treatment models, offer innovative solutions for understanding and managing the CKD-sarcopenia axis. This review underscores the need for integrated therapeutic strategies and multidisciplinary collaboration to mitigate muscle wasting and improve outcomes in CKD patients.

    "abstract": "Research on brain aging is crucial for understanding age-related neurodegenerative disorders and developing several therapeutic interventions. Numerous models ranging from two-dimensional (2D) cell-based, invertebrate, vertebrate, and sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) models have been used to understand the process of brain aging. Invertebrate models are ideal for researching conserved aging processes because of their simplicity, short lifespans, and genetic tractability. Moreover, vertebrate models, including zebrafish and rodents, exhibit more complex nervous systems and behaviors, enabling the exploration of age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. 2D cell culture models derived from primary cells or immortalized cell lines are widely used for mechanistic studies at the cellular level but lack the physiological complexity of brain tissue. Recent advancements have shifted focus to 3D models, which better recapitulate the brain's microenvironment. Organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells mimic human brain architecture and enable the study of cell-cell interactions and aging in a human-specific context. Brain-on-a-chip systems integrate microfluidics and 3D cultures to model blood-brain barrier dynamics and neuronal networks. Additionally, scaffold-based 3D cultures and spheroids provide intermediate complexity, allowing researchers to study extracellular matrix interactions and age-related changes in neuronal function. These 3D models bridge the gap between traditional 2D cultures and animal-based in vivo studies, offering unprecedented insights into brain aging mechanisms. By combining these diverse models, researchers can unravel the multifaceted processes of brain aging and accelerate the development of targeted therapies for age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Growing old is the major risk factor for hundreds of distinct conditions. Thus, ageing of the global population will pose major social, medical, and economic challenges unless this ill health can be ameliorated or reversed. Accordingly, it is increasingly clear that cross-disciplinary approaches to understanding ageing, although not essential, allow collaborative teams to develop new methodologies which can accelerate translation of research into interventions. Co-creation of new concepts and technologies also brings reciprocal benefits to the individual disciplines involved. The evolution of human ageing is a case in point. Whilst there is broad consensus concerning the process and factors shaping the evolution of ageing in general their relative contributions to the evolution of human ageing remain less clear. This is due to three distinct factors. The extended genetic bottlenecks to which H. sapiens was exposed until the termination of the last ice age which sharply distinguishes our species from almost all current ageing models. Sociality, which humans share with many, but not all, living primate species; and finally, an extended post reproductive menopausal period which is extremely rare in the biosphere and uniquely long in humans. Accordingly, a symposium on the physiology and demography of early human evolution was organised by the authors at which palaeodemographers, archaeologists, population biologists and geroscientists discussed human ageing. This has generated important interdisciplinary research priorities which could accelerate the development of treatments for older people in the present and transform key aspects of our understanding of the ageing process in the past.",

    "abstract": "Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) represent a major public health challenge in the aging population, with age-related cerebromicrovascular dysfunction playing a critical role in its development. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cerebromicrovascular aging is crucial for devising strategies to mitigate this burden. Among the key hallmarks of aging, genomic instability and genetic heterogeneity have emerged as significant drivers of age-related diseases. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a prominent manifestation of this instability, characterized by the non-malignant expansion of hematopoietic stem cell clones that harbor somatic mutations. CHIP is well-established as a contributor to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease through its promotion of chronic inflammation. Given that aging is also a major risk factor for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and VCID, it is likely that the same aging processes driving large artery atherosclerosis in CHIP carriers also impair small vessels, including the cerebral microvasculature. While the role of CHIP in large vessel disease is well-documented, its specific contributions to cerebrovascular aging and microvascular dysfunction remain poorly understood. This review explores the potential role of CHIP in age-related cerebrovascular pathologies, with a particular focus on its contribution to CSVD. We discuss how CHIP-related mutations can promote inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially leading to endothelial dysfunction, dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, microvascular inflammation, and cerebral microhemorrhages. Given the potential implications for VCID, elucidating these mechanisms is critical for developing targeted therapies aimed at reducing the burden of cognitive decline in aging populations. This review aims to highlight the current knowledge gaps and encourage further research into the intersection of CHIP, CSVD, and cognitive aging.",

Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate in the body with age and secrete harmful substances known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), causing chronic inflammation; at the same time, chronic inflammation leads to a decrease in immune system function, known as immunosenescence, which further accelerates the aging process. Cellular senescence and immunosenescence are closely related to a variety of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Studying the mechanisms of cellular senescence and immunosenescence and developing targeted interventions are crucial for improving the immune function and quality of life of elderly people. Here, we review a series of recent studies focusing on the molecular mechanisms of cellular senescence and immunosenescence, the regulation of aging by the immune system, and the latest advances in basic and clinical research on senolytics.

It exerts a context-dependent dual role in cancer initiation and progression, functioning as a tumor suppressor and promoter. The complexity of senescence in cancer arises from its mechanistic diversity, potential reversibility, and heterogeneity. A key mediator of these effects is the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a repertoire of bioactive molecules that influence tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling, modulate cancer cell behavior, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Given its intricate role in cancer biology, senescence presents both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Strategies targeting senescence pathways, including senescence-inducing therapies and senolytic approaches, offer promising avenues for cancer treatment. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular senescence in tumors.

    "abstract": "Curcumin, a natural compound found in turmeric, has shown promise in treating brain-related diseases and conditions associated with aging. Curcumin has shown multiple anti-inflammatory and brain-protective effects, but its clinical use is limited by challenges like poor absorption, specificity and delivery to the right tissues. A range of contemporary approaches at the intersection with bioengineering and systems biology are being explored to address these challenges. Data from preclinical and human studies highlight various neuroprotective actions of curcumin, including the inhibition of neuroinflammation, modulation of critical cellular signaling pathways, promotion of neurogenesis, and regulation of dopamine levels. However, curcumin's multifaceted effects - such as its impact on microRNAs and senescence markers - suggest novel therapeutic targets in neurodegeneration. Tetrahydrocurcumin, a primary metabolite of curcumin, also shows potential due to its presence in circulation and its anti-inflammatory properties, although further research is needed to elucidate its neuroprotective mechanisms. Recent advancements in delivery systems, particularly brain-targeting nanocarriers like polymersomes, micelles, and liposomes, have shown promise in enhancing curcumin's bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy in animal models. Furthermore, the exploration of drug-laden scaffolds and dermal delivery may extend the pharmacological applications of curcumin. Studies reviewed here indicate that engineered dermal formulations and devices could serve as viable alternatives for neuroprotective treatments and to manage skin or musculoskeletal inflammation.

Comparing in vitro and in vivo mouse studies, and in vitro studies in humans, supported by visualizations of data interconnections, we show consistent patterns in how such reprogramming modulates key biological processes. Generally, partial reprogramming drives dynamic chromatin remodelling, involving histone modifications that regulate accessibility and facilitate pluripotency gene activation while silencing somatic identity. These changes are accompanied by modifications in stress response programs, such as inflammation, autophagy, and cellular senescence, as well as improved mitochondrial activity and dysregulation of extracellular matrix pathways. We also underscore the challenges in evaluating complex processes like aging and cellular senescence, given the variability in biomarkers used across studies. Overall, we highlight biological processes consistently influenced by reprogramming while noting that some effects are context-dependent, varying according to cell type, species, sex, recovery time, and the reprogramming method employed.

    "abstract": "Following the demographic shift towards an ageing population over the past century, particularly in developed countries, the concept of healthspan has gained increasing acceptance as a key framework for understanding the drivers of healthy ageing. Accordingly, long-lived individuals, such as nonagenarians and centenarians, who remain free from chronic diseases, provide a valuable model to investigate the complex interplay of biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to exceptional longevity. Although there are other longevity hotspots worldwide, five regions, known as Blue Zones, are widely recognized for their exceptionally long-lived populations. Among the various determinants of healthy ageing, the eating patterns of long-lived individuals in Blue Zones include a variety of polyphenol-rich foods, which may contribute to their healthy phenotype. A significant body of evidence suggests that polyphenols, a large family of compounds ubiquitously found in plant-based foods, may exhibit geroprotective activity by influencing underlying biological mechanisms of ageing and promoting optimal longevity. While identifying several knowledge gaps that future investigations should address, the goal of this review is to provide an overview of how specific polyphenols found in foods commonly consumed by long-lived individuals residing in the Blue Zones may mitigate the risk of age-related diseases.

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of permanent loss of proliferative capacity. Therefore, cells that reach a senescent state prevent tumor initiation, acting as an anti-tumor mechanism. However, despite not being proliferative, senescent cells have high secretory activity, constituting the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). SASP includes thousands of soluble molecules and extracellular vesicles, through which senescent cells can affect other cells and the extracellular matrix. In advanced tumors, the enrichment of senescent cells can have anti- or pro-tumor effects depending on features like SASP composition, tumor microenvironment (TME) composition, the anatomic site, histopathologic characteristics of malignancy, and tumor molecular background. We reviewed the studies assessing the impact of the senescence status, measured by mRNA or lncRNA molecular signatures, in the prognosis and other clinically relevant information in cancer, including anti-tumor immunity and response to therapy. We discussed the pros and cons of different strategies to define those molecular signatures and the main limitations of the studies. Finally, we also raised clinical challenges regarding the crossroad between cellular senescence and cancer prognosis, including some therapeutic opportunities in the field.",

This has led to an exponential growth in research on aging, which, coupled to a massive financial influx of funding in the private and public sectors, has resulted in seminal insights into the underpinnings of this biological process. However, critical validation in humans has been hampered by the limited translatability of results obtained in model organisms, additionally confined by the need for extremely time-consuming clinical studies in the ostensible absence of robust biomarkers that would allow monitoring in shorter time frames. In the future, molecular parameters might hold great promise in this regard. In contrast, biomarkers centered on function, resilience, and frailty are available at the present time, with proven predictive value for morbidity and mortality. In this review, the current knowledge of molecular and physiological aspects of human aging, potential antiaging strategies, and the basis, evidence, and potential application of physiological biomarkers in human aging are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The traditional view of aging as a gradual, progressive process is increasingly being challenged. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of abrupt transitions in the aging process, marked by sudden molecular shifts. Interestingly, the data indicates that such transitions occur not only in late life but also throughout the entire lifespan. Further research on the nature of such events could enhance our understanding of aging and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies, including personalized medicine. We propose that these abrupt molecular shifts could serve as biomarkers, dividing the lifespan into distinct stages and providing the foundation for a much-needed staging system for aging. Furthermore, we argue that the sudden changes may be the hallmarks of aging tipping points, that is, points in time where aging processes are quickly amplified after surpassing critical biological thresholds.",

    "abstract": "With the growing elderly population and increasing incidence of various aging-related diseases, the scientific community is faced with an urgent challenge to identify natural anti-aging agents. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) polysaccharides have been proven to have good anti-aging activities. This article reviews the literature on the anti-aging pathways of traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides applied to Caenorhabditis elegans models in the past decade. In our study, we found that 45 TCM polysaccharides from 28 genera and 26 families could delay the aging process of C. elegans. Traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides delay the aging of C. elegans mainly by anti-oxidative stress, eliminating free radicals, repairing DNA damage, and insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS signaling pathway). In addition, an increasing number of traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides have been found to prolong the lifespan of C. elegans by reducing inflammation, regulating intestinal flora, and affecting immune cell function. In this paper, C. elegans was used as an animal model to clarify the anti-aging pathway of traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides, so as to provide theoretical guidance for future research and clinical experiments on the anti-aging effect of traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "Active Ageing (AA) involves maintaining engagement in physical, social, and mental activities in older adulthood, reflecting societal values and political agendas. Despite various measurement tools, there is no universal standard. The University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ Active Ageing Scale (UJACAS) is increasingly used in Europe but faces inconsistencies from varying response scales across versions. This perspective paper examines these discrepancies and proposes a refined model for AA measurement, emphasizing the dimensions of motivation, ability, opportunity, and activity frequency. The goal is to improve the accuracy of AA assessments by adjusting for personal and environmental limitations, ensuring a fair evaluation that captures the complexities of ageing. The proposed adjustments to the UJACAS scoring model include recalibrating the equation to account for personal and environmental limitations, integrating motivation as a separate measure, and exploring adaptive methodologies to ensure fairer and more nuanced assessments of Active Ageing, particularly for individuals facing disabilities or obstacles. By addressing these issues, this perspective paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of AA tools for older adults. Moreover, adopting these methodological challenges has significant societal implications. Precise measurement of AA is essential for tailoring interventions to the needs of diverse older populations and for designing policies that promote inclusive, healthy and safe ageing. Enhancing the accuracy of AA assessments can inform strategies that empower older adults, mitigate disparities, and foster resilience in ageing communities. This study highlights the necessity of advancing AA measurement frameworks to support evidence-based decisions in public health and social policy.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the most devastating diseases, severely affecting public health and contributing to economic instability. Researchers worldwide are dedicated to developing effective therapeutics to target cancer cells. One promising strategy involves inducing cellular senescence, a complex state in which cells exit the cell cycle. Senescence has profound effects on both physiological and pathological processes, influencing cellular systems through secreted factors that affect surrounding and distant cells. Among these factors are exosomes, small extracellular vesicles that play crucial roles in cellular communication, development, and defense, and can contribute to pathological conditions. Recently, there has been increasing interest in engineering exosomes as precise drug delivery vehicles, capable of targeting specific cells or intracellular components. Studies have emphasized the significant role of exosomes from senescent cells in cancer progression and therapy. Notably, chemotherapeutic agents can alter the tumor microenvironment, induce senescence, and trigger immune responses through exosome-mediated cargo transfer. This review explores the intricate relationship between cellular senescence, exosomes, and cancer, examining how different therapeutics can eliminate cancer cells or promote drug resistance. It also investigates the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways driving these processes, highlighting current challenges and proposing future perspectives to uncover new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.",

As the population ages, the incidence of brain tumors, including GBM, increases, with aging emerging as a significant prognostic factor influencing survival outcomes. This review examines the molecular mechanisms linking aging and brain tumor progression, with a specific focus on glioblastomas. We explore how age-related genetic mutations, alterations in cellular pathways, and changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53, and EGFR/PTEN, which are frequently dysregulated in both aging and brain tumors. Despite the growing recognition of aging as a critical factor in brain tumor biology, therapeutic strategies for elderly patients remain poorly defined, often due to underrepresentation in clinical trials and the complex interplay of comorbidities and treatment side effects. The review also discusses emerging therapeutic approaches, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, which offer promise for improving treatment outcomes by addressing age-related molecular changes. Finally, we emphasize the importance of personalized treatment strategies and the need for further research to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying the aging-brain tumor relationship, ultimately aiming to enhance clinical management and patient quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The body's innate immune system plays a pivotal role in identifying and eliminating cancer cells. However, as the immune system ages, its functionality can deteriorate, becoming dysfunctional, inefficient, or even inactive-a condition referred to as immunosenescence. This decline significantly increases the risk of malignancies. While the pro-cancer effects of T-cell aging have been widely explored, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the impact of aging on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. This review seeks to address this gap, with emphasis on these cell types. Furthermore, although certain cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of cancers, elderly patients are less likely to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. In some cases, they may even experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While senolytic strategies have shown promise in exerting anti-cancer effects, their adverse reactions and potential off-target effects present significant challenges. This review aims to elucidate the pro-cancer effects of immunosenescence, its implications for the efficacy and safety of ICIs, and potential anti-aging treatment strategies. In addition, optimizing anti-aging therapies to minimize adverse reactions and enhance therapeutic outcomes remains a critical focus for future research endeavors.",

Some drugs routinely used in the clinics also have anti-senescence effects. However, multiple challenges hinder the application of novel anti-senescence therapeutics in the clinical setting. Understanding the biology of cellular senescence, advantages and pitfalls of anti-senescence treatments, and patients who can profit from these interventions is necessary to introduce this novel therapeutic modality into the clinics.

This review delves into the anti-aging properties of metformin, highlighting its role in mitochondrial energy modulation, activation of the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, stimulation of autophagy, and mitigation of inflammation linked to cellular aging. Furthermore, we discuss its influence on epigenetic modifications that underpin genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. Metformin's potential in addressing age-associated disorders including metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases is also explored. The Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial aims to provide key evidence on its efficacy in delaying aging in humans. Despite these promising insights, significant challenges persist in gaining a more comprehensive understanding into its underlying mechanisms, determining optimal dosing strategies, and evaluating long-term safety in non-diabetic populations.

Accumulation of senescent cells is an important feature of aging that contributes to age-related diseases. How age-related cellular senescence affects brain health and whether this phenomenon contributes to neuropathogenesis in PD is not yet fully understood.

Studying senescence in PD presents challenges and holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, which could contribute to the development of effective disease-modifying therapeutics.

    "abstract": "Ageing of the cardiovascular system is associated with frailty and various life-threatening diseases. As global populations grow older, age-related conditions increasingly determine healthspan and lifespan. The circulatory system not only supplies nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the human body and removes by-products but also builds the largest interorgan communication network, thereby serving as a gatekeeper for healthy ageing. Therefore, elucidating organ-specific and cell-specific ageing mechanisms that compromise circulatory system functions could have the potential to prevent or ameliorate age-related cardiovascular diseases. In support of this concept, emerging evidence suggests that targeting the circulatory system might restore organ function. In this Roadmap, we delve into the organ-specific and cell-specific mechanisms that underlie ageing-related changes in the cardiovascular system. We raise unanswered questions regarding the optimal design of clinical trials, in which markers of biological ageing in humans could be assessed. We provide guidance for the development of gerotherapeutics, which will rely on the technological progress of the diagnostic toolbox to measure residual risk in elderly individuals. A major challenge in the quest to discover interventions that delay age-related conditions in humans is to identify molecular switches that can delay the onset of ageing changes. To overcome this roadblock, future clinical trials need to provide evidence that gerotherapeutics directly affect one or several hallmarks of ageing in such a manner as to delay, prevent, alleviate or treat age-associated dysfunction and diseases.",

Age-related changes in LNs, such as fibrosis and lipomatosis, disrupt the LN architecture and reduce immune cell recruitment and function, impairing immune responses to infections and vaccinations. The review discusses the structural and functional decline of various LNSC subsets, including fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and blood endothelial cells (BECs), highlighting their roles in immune cell activation and homeostasis. Potential strategies to restore aged LNSC function, such as enhancing LNSC activation during vaccination and using senotherapeutics, are explored. Outstanding questions regarding the mechanisms of LNSC ageing and how ageing of the LN stroma might impact autoimmune disorders are also addressed.

    "abstract": "Nutrition and exercise play a pivotal role in counteracting the effects of aging, promoting health, and improving physical fitness in older adults. This perspective study examines their interplay, highlighting their combined potential to preserve muscle mass, cognitive function, and quality of life. The objective is to address gaps in the current understanding, such as the frequent neglect of dietary intake in exercise interventions and vice versa, which can limit their effectiveness. Through a synthesis of the existing literature, we identify key findings, emphasizing the importance of adequate nutritional intake-particularly protein, essential amino acids, and micronutrients-in supporting exercise benefits and preventing sarcopenia and malnutrition. Additionally, supplementation strategies, such as omega-3 fatty acids, creatine, and essential amino acids, are explored alongside the emerging role of the gut microbiota in mediating the benefits of nutrition and exercise. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including determining optimal dosages and timing and addressing individual variability in responses. Personalized approaches tailored to sex differences, gut microbiota diversity, and baseline health conditions are critical for maximizing intervention outcomes. Our conclusions underscore the necessity of integrated strategies that align dietary and exercise interventions to support healthy and active aging. By addressing these gaps, future research can provide actionable insights to optimize health and quality of life in older populations.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence, identified as a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, has become central to understanding aging and disease. Initially seen as a cellular aging mechanism, it is now recognized for its roles in development, tissu repair and tumour suppression. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. Recent efforts have focused on \"senotherapeutics\", including senolytics, which aim to eliminate senescent cells to mitigate age-related decline. Despite significant advances, senescence research faces critical challenges because of inconsistent detection methods. Common markers, such as p16INK4a and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase, vary across tissues and contexts, complicating cross-study comparisons and clinical applications. A standardized multifaceted approach to senescence detection is essential, and should incorporate complementary methods, clear thresholds for senescence classification and considerations for cell type-specific variations. Such standardization would enhance reproducibility, streamline research and facilitate clinical translation, advancing therapeutic applications in aging and disease management.",

    "title": "Endothelial dysfunction in the aging kidney.",
    "abstract": "Global population aging is an escalating challenge in modern society, especially as it impairs the function of multiple organs and increases the burden of age-related diseases. The kidneys, in particular, experience function decline, reduced regenerative capacity, and increased susceptibility to injury as they age. As a result, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rises with aging, further contributing to the growing health burden in older populations. One of the key factors in this process is the dysfunction of specialized renal endothelial cells (RECs), which are essential for maintaining kidney health by regulating blood flow and supporting filtration, solute and water reabsorption, and vascular integrity. As the kidneys age, REC dysfunction drives vascular and microenvironmental changes, contributing to the overall decline in kidney function. In this review, we outline the structural and functional effects of aging on the kidney's macrovascular and microvascular compartments and provide a phenotypic description of the aged endothelium. We particularly focus on the molecular and metabolic rewiring driving and sustaining growth-arrested EC senescence phenotype. We finally give an overview of senotherapies acting on ECs, especially of those modulating metabolism. Given that the pathophysiological processes underlying kidney aging largely overlap with those observed in CKD, REC rejuvenation could also benefit patients with CKD. Moreover, such interventions may hold promise in improving the outcomes of aged kidney transplants. Hence, advancing our understanding of REC and kidney aging will create opportunities for innovations that could improve outcomes for both elderly individuals and patients with CKD.",

This review highlights the critical importance of MAMs as a frontier in cell biology with far-reaching implications for health, disease and ageing. MAMs serve as dynamic communication hubs between the ER and mitochondria, orchestrating essential processes such as calcium signalling, lipid metabolism and cellular stress responses. Recent research has implicated MAM dysfunction in a wide array of conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The significant lack of biological knowledge behind MAM function emphasizes the need to study these enigmatic subcellular sites in greater detail. Key open questions include the mechanisms controlling MAM formation and disassembly, the full complement of MAM-associated proteins and how MAMs contribute to cellular decision-making and ageing processes. Advancing our understanding of MAMs through interdisciplinary approaches and cutting-edge technologies promises to reveal new insights into fundamental cellular signalling pathways and potentially lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for a range of diseases. As such, MAM research represents a critical open question in biology with the potential to transform our understanding of cellular life and human health.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) represents a global health-care challenge. Recent progress in immunotherapy has elicited attracted considerable attention as a viable treatment option through modulating the host immune system and unleashing pre-existing immunity, which has profoundly revolutionized oncology, especially GC. Nonetheless, low clinical response and intrinsic and acquired resistance remain persistently challenging. The microenvironment of GC comprising multifarious stromal cell types has remarkable immunosuppressive elements that may impact the efficacy of immunotherapy. Immunosenescence is increasingly regarded as a factor that contributes to cancer development, remodels the tumor microenvironment and affects the efficacy of immunotherapy. Natural products are at the forefront of traditional medicine. Senotherapeutics is a class of drugs and natural products capable of delaying, preventing, or reversing the senescence process (i.e., senolytics) or suppressing senescence-associated secretory phenotype (i.e., senomorphics). Emerging evidence supports that natural products can improve the efficacy of existing immunotherapy and expand their indications in GC mainly based upon remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment and reversing immunosenescence. The review provides an integrated review of previously reported and ongoing clinical trials with immunotherapeutic regimens in GC and discusses current challenges. Next, we focus on natural compounds that exert anti-GC functions and possess immunomodulatory properties. More attention is paid to the potential of these natural compounds in modulating the immune microenvironment and immunosenescence. Lastly, we discuss the nanomedicine that can overcome the deficiencies of natural products. Altogether, our review suggests the enormous potential of natural compounds in GC immunotherapy, and provides an important direction for future research.",

However, the clinical implementation of senotherapy faces significant hurdles, including lack of precise methods for SCs identification and the potential for adverse effects associated with highly cytotoxic senolytic agents. In this account, we elucidate recent advancement in developing novel approaches for the detection and selective elimination of SCs, encompassing prodrugs, nanoparticles, and other cutting-edge drug delivery systems such as PROTAC technology and CAR T cell therapy. Furthermore, we explore the paradoxical nature of SCs, which can induce growth arrest in adjacent neoplastic cells and recruit immunomodulatory cells that contribute to tumor suppression. Therefore, we utilize SCs membrane as vehicles to elicit antitumor immunity and potentially augment existing anti-cancer therapies. Finally, the opportunities and challenges are put forward to facilitate the development and clinical transformation of SCs detection, elimination or utilization.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that young, chow-fed inbred mice poorly model the complexity of human carcinogenesis. In humans, age and adiposity are major risk factors for malignancies, but most genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) induce carcinogenesis too rapidly to study these influences. Standard strains, such as C57BL/6, commonly used in GEMMs, further limit the exploration of aging and metabolic health effects. A similar challenge arises in modeling periodontitis, a disease influenced by aging, diabesity, and genetic architecture. We propose using diverse mouse populations with hybrid vigor, such as the Collaborative Cross (CC)âÃâApcMin hybrid, to slow disease progression and better model human colorectal cancer (CRC) and comorbidities. This perspective highlights the advantages of this model, where delayed carcinogenesis reveals interactions with aging and adiposity. Unlike ApcMin mice, which develop cancer rapidly, CCâÃâApcMin hybrids recapitulate human-like progression. This facilitates the identification of modifier loci affecting inflammation, diet susceptibility, organ size, and polyposis distribution. The CCâÃâApcMin model offers a transformative platform for studying CRC as a disease of adulthood, reflecting its complex interplay with aging and comorbidities. The insights gained from this approach will enhance early detection, management, and treatment strategies for CRC and related conditions.",

    "abstract": "The increasing global elderly population, projected to reach 20Â % of individuals aged 65 and over by 2030, faces significant pulmonary challenges, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Aging is associated with a natural decline in lung function and structural changes that exacerbate respiratory issues. COPD, characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction, presents a unique challenge in older patients due to the accelerated decline in lung function. Acetylcholine plays a pivotal role in airway dynamics through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly M3 subtype, which mediates bronchoconstriction. The efficacy of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) may differ in older adults, with evidence suggesting that these patients can respond favorably to LAMA treatment. This study utilized meta-analysis and meta-regression to explore the efficacy and safety of LAMA in treating COPD, while considering aging as a potential modifier. A meta-analysis of Phase III randomized controlled trials highlighted significant improvements in trough forced expiratory volume in the 1st second when LAMA were compared to placebo (PCB). Furthermore, the meta-regression revealed a trend suggesting older adults may experience enhanced benefits from LAMA therapy, particularly with once-daily regimens. Safety outcomes, including serious adverse events (SAE), cardiovascular SAE, and mortality, were not modulated by age when comparing LABA to PCB. Overall, these findings support the use of LAMA in elderly COPD patients and underscore the need for tailored treatment strategies to improve clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence precipitates a decline in physiological activities and metabolic functions, often accompanied by heightened inflammatory responses, diminished immune function, and impaired tissue and organ performance. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underpinning cellular senescence remain incompletely elucidated. Emerging evidence implicates circadian rhythm and hypoxia as pivotal factors in cellular senescence. Circadian proteins are central to the molecular mechanism governing circadian rhythm, which regulates homeostasis throughout the body. These proteins mediate responses to hypoxic stress and influence the progression of cellular senescence, with protein Brain and muscle arnt-like 1 (BMAL1 or Arntl) playing a prominent role. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±), a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis within the cellular microenvironment, orchestrates the transcription of genes involved in various physiological processes. HIF-1Î± not only impacts normal circadian rhythm functions but also can induce or inhibit cellular senescence. Notably, HIF-1Î± may aberrantly interact with BMAL1, forming the HIF-1Î±-BMAL1 heterodimer, which can instigate multiple physiological dysfunctions. This heterodimer is hypothesized to modulate cellular senescence by affecting the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythm and hypoxia signaling pathways. In this review, we elucidate the intricate relationships among circadian rhythm, hypoxia, and cellular senescence. We synthesize diverse evidence to discuss their underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets to address cellular senescence. Additionally, we discuss current challenges and suggest potential directions for future research. This work aims to deepen our understanding of the interplay between circadian rhythm, hypoxia, and cellular senescence, ultimately facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies for aging and related diseases.",

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the interplay between sarcopenia and cardiogeriatrics, emphasizing shared mechanisms such as chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), hormonal dysregulation, oxidative stress, and physical inactivity. Despite advancements in diagnostic frameworks, such as the EWGSOP2 and AWGS definitions, variability in criteria and assessment methods continues to challenge standardization. Key diagnostic tools include dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) for muscle mass, alongside functional measures such as grip strength and gait speed. The review highlights the bidirectional relationship between sarcopenia and cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure, aortic stenosis, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which exacerbate each other through complex pathophysiological mechanisms. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the mTOR pathway, NAD+ metabolism, and senescence-related processes offer promise in mitigating sarcopenia's progression. Additionally, integrated interventions combining resistance training, nutritional optimization, and novel anti-aging therapies hold significant potential for improving outcomes. This paper underscores critical gaps in the evidence, including the need for longitudinal studies to establish causality and the validation of advanced therapeutic approaches in clinical settings. Future research should leverage multi-omics technologies and machine learning to identify biomarkers and personalize interventions.

Recent advancements in the fields of epigenetics and senolytics offer promising avenues for understanding and addressing age-related diseases. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, with mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation playing critical roles in aging. Senolytics, a class of drugs targeting and eliminating senescent cells, address the accumulation of dysfunctional cells that contribute to tissue degradation and chronic inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. This scoping review examines the intersection of epigenetic mechanisms and senolytic therapies in aging, focusing on their combined potential for therapeutic interventions. Senescent cells display distinct epigenetic signatures, such as DNA hypermethylation and histone modifications, which can be targeted to enhance senolytic efficacy. Epigenetic reprogramming strategies, such as induced pluripotent stem cells, may further complement senolytics by rejuvenating aged cells. Integrating epigenetic modulation with senolytic therapy offers a dual approach to improving healthspan and mitigating age-related pathologies.

GATA4, a vital transcription factor identified for modulating cardiovascular biology and cellular senescence, is recognized for its critical involvement in CVD pathogenesis. This review collected relevant studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct using search terms like 'GATA4,' 'cellular senescence,' 'coronary artery diseases,' 'hypertension,' 'heart failure,' 'arrhythmias,' 'congenital heart diseases,' 'cardiomyopathy,' and 'cardiovascular disease.'

Dysregulation of GATA4 is involved in a variety of CVDs, as demonstrated by both experimental and clinical research, comprising CAD, hypertension, congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and cardiac insufficiency. Furthermore, cellular senescence enhances the advancement of age-related CVDs.

Given its similarities to Alzheimer's disease in humans, CDS has gained attention as a target for nutrition-based interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of enriched diets and nutraceuticals in improving cognition in aging companion animals. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, CAB Abstracts, Web of Science, and Dimensions to identify clinical trials published in English that investigated the effects of enriched diets or nutraceuticals on cognitive functions in aged cats or dogs. Study quality was assessed using a modified CAMARADES checklist. A total of 30 studies (27 canine and 2 feline trials) published between 2002 and 2023 were reviewed. Studies on enriched diets generally demonstrated higher methodological quality compared to those on supplements. Omega-3 fatty acids showed cognitive benefits in aging pets, especially at higher doses, while antioxidants from plant extracts and products and vitamins E and C alone were less effective but remain essential for stabilizing omega-3 fatty acids. Other supplements, including S-adenosyl methionine, medium-chain triglycerides, homotaurine, and apoaequorin, also showed promise.

    "abstract": "Modulating immune function is a critical strategy in cancer and atherosclerosis treatments. For cancer, boosting or maintaining the immune system is crucial to prevent tumor growth. However, in vascular disease, mitigating immune responses can decrease inflammation and slow atherosclerosis progression. Anti-inflammatory therapy, therefore, presents a unique dilemma for cancer survivors: while it may decrease cardiovascular risk, it might also promote cancer growth and metastasis by suppressing the immune response. Senescence presents a potentially targetable solution to this challenge; senescence increases the risk of both cancer therapy resistance and vascular disease. Exercise, notably, shows promise in delaying this premature senescence, potentially improving cancer outcomes and lowering vascular disease risk post-treatment. This review focuses on the long-term impact of cancer therapies on vascular health. We underscore the importance of modulating senescence to balance cancer treatment's effectiveness and its vascular impact, and we emphasize investigating the role of exercise-mediated suppression of senescence in improving cancer survivorship.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most prevalent form of lung cancer, remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, particularly among elderly individuals. The phenomenon of immunosenescence, characterized by the progressive decline in immune cell functionality with aging, plays a pivotal role in NSCLC progression and contributes to the diminished efficacy of therapeutic interventions in older patients. Immunosenescence manifests through impaired immune surveillance, reduced cytotoxic responses, and increased chronic inflammation, collectively fostering a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the molecular, cellular, and genetic mechanisms of immunosenescence and its impact on immune surveillance and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in NSCLC. We explore how aging affects various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, and macrophages, and how these changes compromise the immune system's ability to detect and eliminate tumor cells. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by immunosenescence to current therapeutic strategies, particularly immunotherapy, which faces significant hurdles in elderly patients due to immune dysfunction. The review highlights emerging technologies, such as single-cell sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9, which offer new insights into immunosenescence and its potential as a therapeutic target. Finally, we outline future research directions, including strategies for rejuvenating the aging immune system and optimizing immunotherapy for older NSCLC patients, with the goal of improving treatment efficacy and survival outcomes. These efforts hold promise for the development of more effective, personalized therapies for elderly patients with NSCLC.",

There is evidence for the interactions between fungi and immunosenescence in potentially regulating cancer progression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we summarize potential roles of commensal and pathogenic fungi in modulating cancer-associated processes and provide more-detailed discussions on the mechanisms of which fungi affect tumor biology, including local and distant regulation of the TME, modulating antitumor immune responses and interactions with neighboring bacterial commensals. We also delineate the features of immunosenescence and its influence on cancer development and treatment, and highlight the interactions between fungi and immunosenescence in cancer. We discuss the prospects and challenges for harnessing fungi and immunosenescence in cancer diagnosis and/or treatment.

The aging of the neurovasculature is a critical determinant of brain aging and disease risk. Neurovascular cells are particularly vulnerable to aging, which induces significant structural and functional changes in arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels. Consequently, neurovascular aging impairs oxygen and glucose delivery to active brain regions, disrupts endothelial transport mechanisms essential for blood-brain exchange, compromises proteostasis by reducing the clearance of potentially toxic proteins, weakens immune surveillance and privilege, and deprives the brain of key growth factors required for repair and renewal. In this review, we examine the effects of neurovascular aging on brain function and its role in stroke, vascular cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we discuss key unanswered questions that must be addressed to develop neurovascular strategies aimed at promoting healthy brain aging.",

However, mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to various pathological changes, including cellular aging, necrosis, dysregulated tumor immunity, and the initiation and progression of cancer. Moreover, abnormal mitochondrial metabolism is closely associated with numerous diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancers. In recent years, targeting mitochondria has emerged as a promising anticancer strategy, aiming to modulate mitochondrial functions and metabolism for therapeutic benefits. Nonetheless, such approaches face limitations, including low delivery efficiency and insufficient specificity. This review systematically explores mitochondrial structure and function, their physiological and pathological roles, and the potential and challenges of mitochondria-targeted strategies in cancer therapy, providing insights for future research directions.",

Various factors impede mineral acquisition and absorption including reduced appetite, depressed gastric acid production and dysregulation across a range of signalling pathways in the intestinal mucosa. Minerals are required in sufficient levels since they are critical for the proper functioning of metabolic processes in cells and tissues, including energy metabolism, DNA and protein synthesis, immune function, mobility, and skeletal integrity. When uptake is diminished or loss exceeds absorption, alternative approaches are required to enable individuals to maintain adequate mineral levels. Currently, supplementation has been used effectively in populations for the restoration of levels of some minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium, but these may not be without inherent challenges. Therefore, in this chapter we review the current understanding around the effectiveness of mineral supplementation for the minerals most clinically relevant for the elderly.",

Stem cell therapies, standing at the frontier of regenerative medicine, hold the potential to mitigate the challenges induced by ageing. By harnessing the unique regenerative capabilities of stem cells, these therapies aim to renew and heal ageing or damaged cells and tissues, thereby bolstering their function. In this chapter, we explore the potential of stem cell-based interventions against age-related degeneration, emphasising their underlying mechanisms, challenges, and future possibilities. As elucidated by the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, ageing is characterised by an accrual of macromolecular damage, genomic instability, and loss of heterochromatin (Campisi et al. Nature 571:183-192, 2019). These aspects culminate in stem cell fatigue and a dwindling tissue regenerative capacity. However, with the advent of stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine, we now hold the tools to reverse these age-induced changes by rejuvenating stem cells, the keystones of tissue regeneration, and fostering their proliferation and differentiation.",

Aging affects the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) and immune function decline (immunosenescence). These changes would impair defense mechanisms, increase susceptibility to infections and reduce vaccine efficacy in older adults. Cellular senescence exacerbates these issues by releasing pro-inflammatory factors, further perpetuating chronic inflammation. Moreover, comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which are common in older adults, amplify immune dysfunction, while immunosuppressive medications further complicate responses to infections. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving inflammaging and immunosenescence, focusing on genomic instability, telomere attrition, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we discussed how aging-associated immune alterations influence responses to bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and evaluated emerging antiaging strategies, aimed at mitigating these effects to improve health outcomes in the aging population.",

Here, we review genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 44 reproductive traits of both female and male individuals from 2007 to early 2024, examining reproductive behavior, reproductive lifespan and aging, infertility and hormonal concentration. Using the GWAS Catalog as a basis, from 159 relevant studies, we isolate 37 genes that harbor association signals for four or more reproductive traits, more than half of which are linked to rare Mendelian disorders, including ten genes linked to reproductive-related disorders: FSHB, MCM8, DNAH2, WNT4, ESR1, IGSF1, THRB, BRWD1, CYP19A1 and PTPRF.

Cellular senescence, marked by irreversible cell-cycle arrest, is emerging as a crucial factor in various neurodegenerative diseases.

Its innate neuroprotective advantage can also be shared with the brain when normal aging-dependent processes challenge neural circuits. The intricate relationship between BDNF and resilience during the aging process signifies the molecular mechanisms that underlie the maintenance and protection of brain function, such as cognition, movement and psychological well-being. As BDNF is crucial for neuronal growth and survival, it can also promote resilience against age-related functional decline and frailty, even if it fails to entirely prevent aging-related functional decline. In the present review, we discuss BDNF function from a neuroprotective perspective and how it may promote resilience in aging. We emphasize briefly the principal, well-known cellular hallmarks of brain aging and how BDNF may restrict such disabling molecular dynamics and enhance overall functional resilience in aging. Insight into the molecular pathways through which BDNF reduces age-related brain dysfunctions and/or improves resilience, provides a foundation for developing targeted interventions to promote mental well-being in an aging population.",

A common outcome is the altered response exerted by the immune system to counteract infections, known as immunosenescence, which has been recognized as a primary cause, among others, of the so-called long-COVID syndrome. Moreover, the uncontrolled immunoreaction leads to a state of subacute, chronic inflammatory state known as inflammaging, responsible in turn for the chronicization of concomitant pathologies in a self-sustaining process. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs are the current choice for the therapy of inflammaging in post-COVID complications, with contrasting results. The increasing knowledge of the biochemical pathways of inflammaging led to disclose new small molecules-based therapies directed toward different biological targets involved in inflammation, immunological response, and oxidative stress. Herein, paying particular attention to recent clinical data and preclinical literature, we focus on the role of endocannabinoid system in inflammaging, and the promising therapeutic option represented by the CB2R agonists, the role of novel ligands of the formyl peptide receptor 2 and ultimately the potential of newly discovered monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors with neuroprotective activity in the treatment of immunosenescence.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) poses a significant challenge in orthopedics. Inflammatory pathways are regarded as central mechanisms in the onset and progression of OA. Growing evidence suggests that senescence acts as a mediator in inflammation-induced OA. Given the lack of effective treatments for OA, there is an urgent need for a clearer understanding of its pathogenesis. In this review, we systematically summarize the cross-talk between cellular senescence and inflammation in OA. We begin by focusing on the mechanisms and hallmarks of cellular senescence, summarizing evidence that supports the relationship between cellular senescence and inflammation. We then discuss the mechanisms of interaction between cellular senescence and inflammation, including senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) and the effects of pro- and anti-inflammatory interventions on cellular senescence. Additionally, we focus on various types of cellular senescence in OA, including senescence in cartilage, subchondral bone, synovium, infrapatellar fat pad, stem cells, and immune cells, elucidating their mechanisms and impacts on OA. Finally, we highlight the potential of therapies targeting senescent cells in OA as a strategy for promoting cartilage regeneration.",

That is, acute (<24 h) stable isotope-derived measures of muscle protein synthesis have led to established recommendations for protein quantity, quality, source, and timing of protein ingestion to support muscle health at rest, post exercise, and to overcome age-related anabolic resistance in older adults. Although muscle health is undoubtedly important, moving from muscle to other associated or disease-specific outcomes is a critical next step for the field, given the mounting evidence documenting the effects of dietary protein on measures of chronic disease and age-related decline (for example, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, frailty, and osteoporosis). In this narrative review, we posit that future studies evaluating the potential role of dietary protein build off of the existing knowledge base generated from decades of past research and focus their efforts on closing unanswered knowledge gaps pertaining to dietary protein and health across the lifespan.

    "abstract": "Aging presents a significant challenge to health and social care systems due to the increasing proportion of the elderly population. The identification of reliable biomarkers to assess the progression of aging remains an unresolved question. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded covalently closed RNAs. They have been found to regulate various biological processes. CircRNAs are present in human biological fluids, are relatively stable, and accumulate with age, making them promising as biomarkers of aging. Current information on the expression of circRNAs in aging was analyzed using scientific databases. In this review, we have identified key stages in the study of circRNAs during aging and summarized the current understanding of their biogenesis. By focusing on the role of circRNAs in processes that contribute to aging - such as genomic stability, metabolism, cell death, and signaling pathways - we hypothesize that circRNAs may drive the aging process through their age-related accumulation and resultant deregulation. Examples of age-related differential expression of circRNAs in various species, including humans, are provided. This review highlights the importance of finding novel epigenetic biomarkers of aging, beyond the already identified molecules (circFOXO3, circRNA100783, circPVT1), and highlights circRNAs as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of age-associated diseases.",

Injury to the adult brain often results in substantial loss of neural tissue and permanent functional impairment. In contrast with the adult, during development, the mammalian brain exhibits a remarkable capacity to replace lost cells. A plethora of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulate the age-dependent loss of regenerative potential in the brain. As the developmental window closes, neural stem cells undergo epigenetic changes, limiting their proliferation and differentiation capacities, whereas, changes in the brain microenvironment pose additional challenges opposing regeneration, including inflammation and gliosis. Therefore, studying the regenerative mechanisms during development and identifying what impairs them with age may provide key insights into how to stimulate regeneration in the brain. Here, we will discuss how the mammalian brain engages regenerative mechanisms upon injury or neuron loss. Moreover, we will describe the age-dependent changes that affect these processes.

    "abstract": "Significance: Cellular senescence is a critical process underlying aging and is associated with age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Lipids are implicated in cellular senescence. Fatty acids, particularly eicosanoids, have been associated with various forms of senescence and inflammation, and the associated reactive oxygen species production has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mitigating senescence. When overactivated, calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Recent Advances: With a growing understanding of the importance of lipids as mediators and modulators of senescence, cPLA2 has emerged as a compelling drug target. cPLA2 overactivation plays a significant role in several pathways associated with senescence, including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Critical Issues: Previous cPLA2 inhibitors have shown potential in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress, but the dominant hurdles in the central nervous system-targeting drug discovery are specificity and blood-brain barrier penetrance. Future Directions: With the need for more effective drugs against neurological diseases, we emphasize the significance of discovering new brain-penetrant, potent, and specific cPLA2 inhibitors. We discuss how the recently developed Virtual Synthon Hierarchical Enumeration Screening, an iterative synthon-based approach for fast structure-based virtual screening of billions of compounds, provides an efficient exploration of large chemical spaces for the discovery of brain-penetrant cPLA2 small-molecule inhibitors.

Thus, senescence has a crucial role in development, tissue maintenance and cancer prevention. However, lingering senescent cells fuel chronic inflammation through the acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which contributes to cancer and age-related tissue dysfunction. Recent progress in understanding senescence has spurred interest in the development of approaches to target senescent cells, known as senotherapies. In this Review, we evaluate the status of various types of senotherapies, including senolytics that eliminate senescent cells, senomorphics that suppress the SASP, interventions that mitigate senescence and strategies that harness the immune system to clear senescent cells. We also summarize how these approaches can be combined with cancer therapies, and we discuss the challenges and opportunities in moving senotherapies into clinical practice. Such therapies have the potential to address root causes of age-related diseases and thus open new avenues for preventive therapies and treating multimorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and the risks of both developing a disease and receiving a poor prognosis increase with age. With increasing life expectancy, understanding the mechanisms underlying heart aging has become critical. Traditional techniques have supported research into finding the physiological changes and hallmarks of cardiovascular aging, including oxidative stress, disabled macroautophagy, loss of proteostasis, and epigenetic alterations, among others. The advent of high-throughput multi-omics techniques offers new perspectives on the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes in the heart, guiding the development of therapeutic targets. This review explores the contributions and characteristics of these high-throughput techniques to unraveling heart aging. We discuss how different high-throughput omics approaches, both alone and in combination, produce robust and exciting new findings and outline future directions and prospects in studying heart aging in this new era.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are essential organelles that play crucial roles in various metabolic and signalling pathways. Proper neuronal function is highly dependent on the health of these organelles. Of note, the intricate structure of neurons poses a critical challenge for the transport and distribution of mitochondria to specific energy-intensive domains, such as synapses and dendritic appendages. When faced with chronic metabolic challenges and bioenergetic deficits, neurons undergo degeneration. Unsurprisingly, disruption of mitostasis, the process of maintaining cellular mitochondrial content and function within physiological limits, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several age-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, compromised integrity and metabolic activity of mitochondria is a principal hallmark of neurodegeneration. In this review, we survey recent findings elucidating the role of impaired mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism in the onset and progression of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. We also discuss the importance of neuronal mitostasis, with an emphasis on the major mitochondrial homeostatic and metabolic pathways that contribute to the proper functioning of neurons. A comprehensive delineation of these pathways is crucial for the development of early diagnostic and intervention approaches against neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Elderly individuals (65Â years and older) represent the fastest-growing demographic of new clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases, yet there is a paucity of preclinical research in aged animals. The limited preclinical work available aligns with the clinical literature in that there appear to be significant differences in pathophysiology, recovery potential, and response to medications between animals at different points across the age spectrum. The aim of this review is to discuss the limited studies and highlight critical age-related differences in affective, cognitive, and neurobehavioral deficits, to discuss factors that influence functional outcomes, and to identify targets for future research. The consensus is that aged rodents face challenges related to dysregulated inflammation, reduced neuroplasticity, and age-related cellular changes, which hinder their recovery after TBI. The most successful intervention studies in animal models to date, of the limited array available, have explored interventions targeting inflammatory downregulation. Current standards of neuropsychopharmacology for post-TBI neurocognitive recovery have not been investigated in a significant capacity. In addition, currently available animal models do not sufficiently account for important age-related comorbidities, dual insults, or differences in TBI mechanism of injury in elderly individuals. TBI in the aged population is more likely to lead to additional neurodegenerative diseases that further complicate recovery. The findings underscore the need for tailored therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes in both adult and elderly populations.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a universal biological process characterized by a progressive, cumulative decline in homeostatic capabilities and physiological functions, which inevitably increases vulnerability to diseases. A number of molecular pathomechanisms and hallmarks of aging have been recognized, yet we miss a thorough understanding of their complex interconnectedness. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human aging, with a focus on the multiple roles of high mobility group Box 1 protein (HMGB1), the archetypal damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule. In the nucleus, this non-histone chromatin-associated protein functions as a DNA chaperone and regulator of gene transcription, influencing DNA structure and gene expression. Moreover, this versatile protein can translocate to the cytoplasm to orchestrate other processes, such as autophagy, or be unconventionally secreted into the extracellular environment, where it acts as a DAMP, combining inflammatory and regenerative properties. Notably, lower expression of HMGB1 within the cell and its heightened extracellular release have been associated with diverse age-associated traits, making it a suitable candidate as a universal biomarker of aging. In this review, we outline the evidence implicating HMGB1 in aging, also in light of an evolutionary perspective on its functional pleiotropy, and propose critical issues that need to be addressed to gauge the value of HMGB1 as a potential biomarker across age-related diseases and therapeutic target to promote healthy longevity.",

    "title": "Mitochondria break free: Mitochondria-derived vesicles in aging and associated conditions.",
    "abstract": "Mitophagy is the intracellular recycling system that disposes damaged/inefficient mitochondria and allows biogenesis of new organelles to ensure mitochondrial quality is optimized. Dysfunctional mitophagy has been implicated in human aging and diseases. Multiple evolutionarily selected, redundant mechanisms of mitophagy have been identified, but their specific roles in human health and their potential exploitation as therapeutic targets are unclear. Recently, the characterization of the endosomal-lysosomal system has revealed additional mechanisms of mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control that operate via the production of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs). Circulating MDVs can be isolated and characterized to provide an unprecedented opportunity to study this type of mitochondrial recycling in vivo and to relate it to human physiology and pathology. Defining the role of MDVs in human physiology, pathology, and aging is hampered by the lack of standardized methods to isolate, validate, and characterize these vesicles. Hence, some basic questions about MDVs remain unanswered. While MDVs are generated directly through the extrusion of mitochondrial membranes within the cell, a set of circulating extracellular vesicles leaking from the endosomal-lysosomal system and containing mitochondrial portions have also been identified and warrant investigation. Preliminary research indicates that MDV generation serves multiple biological roles and contributes to restoring cell homeostasis. However, studies have shown that MDVs may also be involved in pathological conditions. Therefore, further research is warranted to establish when/whether MDVs are supporting disease progression and/or are extracting damaged mitochondrial components to alleviate cellular oxidative burden and restore redox homeoastasis. This information will be relevant for exploiting these vesicles for therapeutic purpose. Herein, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical studies on MDVs in aging and associated conditions and discuss the interplay between MDVs and some of the hallmarks of aging (mitophagy, inflammation, and proteostasis). We also outline open questions on MDV research that should be prioritized by future investigations.",

    "abstract": "The age-related decline in appetite and food intake - termed \"anorexia of ageing\" - is implicated in undernutrition in later life and hence provides a public health challenge for our ageing population. Eating behaviour is controlled, in part, by homeostatic mechanisms which sense nutrient status and provide feedback to appetite control regions of the brain. Such feedback signals, propagated by episodic gut hormones, are dysregulated in some older adults. The secretory responses of appetite-related gut hormones to feeding are amplified, inducing a more anorexigenic signal which is associated with reduced appetite and food intake. Such an augmented response would indicate an increase in gut sensitivity to nutrients. Consequently, this review explores the role of gastrointestinal tract nutrient sensing in age-related appetite dysregulation. We review and synthesise evidence for age-related alterations in nutrient sensing which may explain the observed hormonal dysregulation. Drawing on what is known regarding elements of nutrient sensing pathways in animal models, in other tissues of the body, and in certain models of disease, we identify potential causal mechanisms including alterations in enteroendocrine cell number and distribution, dysregulation of cell signalling pathways, and changes in the gut milieu. From identified gaps in evidence, we highlight interesting and important avenues for future research.",

Particular attention should be paid to accurate diagnosis and thorough exclusion of pseudoresistance. Challenges include the likelihood of multimorbidities and polypharmacotherapy in an elderly patient population. Network, cellular, molecular, and metabolic alterations associated with aging and age-related disorders have the potential to affect the intrinsic severity of late-onset epilepsies, neural network function, and the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications (ASMs). Whereas age-related changes in pharmacokinetics tend to favor responsiveness to low doses, respective changes in network excitability and pharmacodynamics of ASMs are more likely to contribute to drug resistance. There are particular gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of drug resistance and the impact of influencing factors in this patient population. Therefore, experimental and clinical research needs to be intensified to advance our understanding of drug-resistant epilepsy in patients with late-onset epilepsies and to develop multivariate prediction algorithms. In this context, the heterogeneity of an elderly patient population should be taken into account, considering differences in etiology, comorbidities, co-medications, frailty, activity and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The constant increase in the elderly population presents significant challenges in addressing new social, economic, and health problems concerning this population. With respect to health, aging is a primary risk factor for age-related diseases, which are driven by interconnected molecular hallmarks that influence the development of these diseases. One of the main mechanisms that has attracted more attention to aging is autophagy, a catabolic process that removes and recycles damaged or dysfunctional cell components to preserve cell viability. The autophagy process can be induced or deregulated in response to a wide range of internal or external stimuli, such as starvation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, damaged organelles, infectious pathogens, and aging. Natural compounds that promote the stimulation of autophagy regulatory pathways, such as mTOR, FoxO1/3, AMPK, and Sirt1, lead to increased levels of essential proteins such as Beclin-1 and LC3, as well as a decrease in p62. These changes indicate the activation of autophagic flux, which is known to be decreased in cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, and cataracts. The regulated administration of natural compounds offers an adjuvant therapeutic alternative in age-related diseases; however, more experimental evidence is needed to support and confirm these health benefits. Hence, this review aims to highlight the potential benefits of natural compounds in regulating autophagy pathways as an alternative approach to combating age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Fisetin, a flavonoid naturally occurring in plants, fruits, and vegetables, has recently gained attention for its potential role as a senotherapeutic agent for the treatment of age-related chronic diseases. Senotherapeutics target senescent cells, which accumulate with age and disease, in both circulating immune cell populations and solid organs and tissues. Senescent cells contribute to development of many chronic diseases, primarily by eliciting systemic chronic inflammation through their senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Here, we explore whether fisetin as a senotherapeutic can eliminate senescent cells, and thereby alleviate chronic diseases, by examining current evidence from in vitro studies and animal models that investigate fisetin's impact on age-related diseases, as well as from phase I/II trials in various patient populations. We discuss the application of fisetin in humans, including challenges and future directions. Our review of available data suggests that targeting senescent cells with fisetin offers a promising strategy for managing multiple chronic diseases, potentially transforming future healthcare for older and multimorbid patients. However, further studies are needed to establish the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of fisetin as a senotherapeutic, identify relevant and reliable outcome measures in human trials, optimize dosing, and better understand the possible limitations of fisetin as a senotherapeutic agent.",

    "title": "High-throughput N-glycan analysis in aging and inflammaging: State of the art and future directions.",
    "abstract": "As the global population ages at an unprecedented rate, the prevalence of age-related diseases is increasing, making inflammaging - a phenomenon characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state that follows aging - a significant concern. Understanding the mechanisms of inflammaging and its impact on health is critical for developing strategies to improve the quality of life and manage health in the aging population. Despite their crucial roles in various biological processes, including immune response modulation, N-glycans, oligosaccharides covalently attached to many proteins, are often overlooked in clinical and research studies. This repeated oversight is largely due to their inherent complexity and the complexity of the analysis methods. High-throughput N-glycan analysis has emerged as a transformative tool in N-glycosylation research, enabling cost- and time-effective, detailed, and large-scale examination of N-glycan profiles. This paper is the first to explore the application of high-throughput N-glycomics techniques to investigate the complex interplay between N-glycosylation and the immune system in aging. Technological advancements have significantly improved Nglycan detection and characterization, providing insights into age-related changes in Nglycosylation. Key findings highlight consistent shifts in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and plasma/serum glycoprotein glycosylation with age, with a pronounced rise in agalactosylated structures bound to IgG that also affect the composition of the total plasma N-glycome. These N-glycan modifications seem to be strongly associated with inflammaging and have been identified as valuable biomarkers for biological age, predictors of disease risk, and proxy biomarkers for monitoring intervention efficacy at the individual level. Despite current challenges related to data complexity and methodological limitations, ongoing technological innovations and interdisciplinary research are expected tofurther advance our knowledge of glycan biology, improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and promote healthier aging. The integration of glycomics with other omics approaches holds promise for a more comprehensive understanding of the aging immune system, paving the way for personalized medicine and targeted interventions to mitigate inflammaging. In conclusion, this paper underscores the transformative impact of high-throughput Nglycan analysis in aging and inflammaging.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells accumulate throughout the body with advanced age, diseases and chronic conditions. They negatively impact health and function of multiple systems, including the central nervous system (CNS). Therapies that target senescent cells, broadly referred to as senotherapeutics, recently emerged as potentially important treatment strategies for the CNS. Promising therapeutic approaches involve clearing senescent cells by disarming their pro-survival pathways with 'senolytics'; or dampening their toxic senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) using 'senomorphics'. Following the pioneering discovery of first-generation senolytics dasatinib and quercetin, dozens of additional therapies have been identified, and several promising targets are under investigation. Although potentially transformative, senotherapies are still in early stages and require thorough testing to ensure reliable target engagement, specificity, safety and efficacy. The limited brain penetrance and potential toxic side effects of CNS-acting senotherapeutics pose challenges for drug development and translation to the clinic. This Review assesses the potential impact of senotherapeutics for neurological conditions by summarizing preclinical evidence, innovative methods for target and biomarker identification, academic and industry drug development pipelines and progress in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The kidney is an essential excretory organ that works as a filter of toxins and metabolic by-products of the human body and maintains osmotic pressure throughout life. The kidney undergoes several physiological, morphological, and structural changes with age. As life expectancy in humans increases, cell senescence in renal aging is a growing challenge. Identifying age-related kidney disorders and their cause is one of the contemporary public health challenges. While the structural abnormalities to the extracellular matrix (ECM) occur, in part, due to changes in MMPs, EMMPRIN, and Meprin-A, a variety of epigenetic modifiers, such as DNA methylation, histone alterations, changes in small non-coding RNA, and microRNA (miRNA) expressions are proven to play pivotal roles in renal pathology. An aged kidney is vulnerable to acute injury due to ischemia-reperfusion, toxic medications, altered matrix proteins, systemic hemodynamics, etc., non-coding RNA and miRNAs play an important role in renal homeostasis, and alterations of their expressions can be considered as a good marker for AKI. Other epigenetic changes, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, are also evident in AKI pathophysiology. The endogenous production of gaseous molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was documented in the early 1980s, but its ameliorative effects, especially on kidney injury, still need further research to understand its molecular mode of action in detail. H2S donors heal fibrotic kidney tissues, attenuate oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and GFR, and also modulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). In this review, we discuss the complex pathophysiological interplay in AKI and its available treatments along with future perspectives. The basic role of H2S in the kidney has been summarized, and recent references and knowledge gaps are also addressed. Finally, the healing effects of H2S in AKI are described with special emphasis on epigenetic regulation and matrix remodeling.",

Given the current limited understanding of the direct relationship between gut microbiota and cardiac aging, there is an urgent need for preclinical and clinical investigations into the mechanistic interactions between gut microbiota and cardiac aging. Such endeavors hold promise for shedding light on the pathophysiology of cardiac aging and uncovering new therapeutic targets for cardiac aging diseases.",

    "title": "Contributions and future potential of animal models for geroscience research on sensory systems.",
    "abstract": "Sensory systems mediate our social interactions, food intake, livelihoods, and other essential daily functions. Age-related decline and disease in sensory systems pose a significant challenge to healthy aging. Research on sensory decline in humans is informative but can often be difficult, subject to sampling bias, and influenced by environmental variation. Study of animal models, including mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, cats, dogs, and non-human primates, plays a complementary role in biomedical research, offering advantages such as controlled conditions and shorter lifespans for longitudinal study. Various species offer different advantages and limitations but have provided key insights in geroscience research. Here we review research on age-related decline and disease in vision, hearing, olfaction, taste, and touch. For each sense, we provide an epidemiological overview of impairment in humans, describing the physiological processes and diseases for each sense. We then discuss contributions made by research on animal models and ideas for future research. We additionally highlight the need for integrative, multimodal research across the senses as well as across disciplines. Long-term studies spanning multiple generations, including on species with longer life spans, are also highly valuable. Overall, integrative studies of appropriate animal models have high translational potential for clinical applications, the development of novel diagnostics, therapies, and medical interventions and future research will continue to close gaps in these areas. Research on animal models to improve understanding of the biology of the aging senses and improve the healthspan and additional research on sensory systems hold special promise for new breakthroughs.",

    "title": "Reproductive endocrinology and aging in human males: An evolutionary perspective.",
    "abstract": "Due to its important role in fertility, reproductive endocrine function has been subject to natural selection in all organisms including human males. Moreover, reproductive endocrine function is subject to change as males age. Indeed, the biology of aging is also subject to natural selection. As males age, hormone function such as variation in testosterone can change as the result of general somatic degradation. However these changes are not universal and can differ between human male populations depending on lifestyle and ecological context. The degree to which this variation is adaptive remains an open question but recent evolutionary anthropology research has provided some clarity. While knowledge of evolutionary approaches has limitations, the benefits of understanding the origins and comparative context of reproductive endocrine function in older human males are significant. This paper discusses our present comprehension of reproductive endocrinology and aging in human males, with a focus on human diversity across varied lifestyles, ecologies, and environments. In addition, comparative great ape research is examined. Current research challenges and future directions related to the importance of evolutionary biology and human diversity for understanding human male aging are discussed.",

In recent years, many promising molecular and omic BOA have emerged with an enormous potential for translational geroscience and improving healthspan. However, clinical translation remains limited, in part due to the gap between preclinical research and the application of BOA in clinical research and other translational settings. We surveyed experts in these areas to better understand current challenges for the translation of aging biomarkers. We identified six key barriers to clinical translation and developed guidance for the field to overcome them. Core recommendations include linking BOA to clinically actionable insights, improving affordability and availability to broad populations and validation of biomarkers that are robust and responsive at the level of individuals. Our work provides key insights and practical recommendations to overcome barriers impeding clinical translation of BOA.",

    "abstract": "Tumour cell senescence can be induced by various factors, including DNA damage, inflammatory signals, genetic toxins, ionising radiation and nutrient metabolism. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), secreted by senescent tumour cells, possesses the capacity to modulate various immune cells, including macrophages, T cells, natural killer cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, as well as vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts within the tumour microenvironment (TME), and this modulation can result in either the promotion or suppression of tumorigenesis and progression. Exploring the impact of SASP on the TME could identify potential therapeutic targets, yet limited studies have dissected its functions. In this review, we delve into the causes and mechanisms of tumour cell senescence. We then concentrate on the influence of SASP on the tumour immune microenvironment, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix and the reprogramming of cancer stem cells, along with their associated tumour outcomes. Last, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse array of senotherapeutics, highlighting their prospective advantages and challenge for the treatment of cancer patients. KEY POINTS: Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion from senescent tumour cells significantly impacts cancer progression and biology. SASP is involved in regulating the remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, including immune microenvironment, vascular, extracellular matrix and cancer stem cells.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are central to cellular energy production, and their dysfunction is a major contributor to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, pivotal factors in aging, and related diseases. With aging, mitochondrial efficiency declines, leading to an increase in ROS and persistent inflammatory responses. Therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial health show promise in mitigating these detrimental effects. Antioxidants such as MitoQ and MitoVitE, and supplements like coenzyme Q10 and NADâ+âprecursors, have demonstrated potential in reducing oxidative stress. Additionally, gene therapy aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function, alongside lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and caloric restriction can ameliorate age-related mitochondrial decline. Exercise not only boosts mitochondrial biogenesis but also improves mitophagy. Enhancing mitophagy is a key strategy to prevent the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and longevity. Pharmacological agents like sulforaphane, SS-31, and resveratrol indirectly promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improve cellular resistance to oxidative damage. The exploration of mitochondrial therapeutics, including emerging techniques like mitochondrial transplantation, offers significant avenues for extending health span and combating age-related diseases. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires overcoming challenges in precisely targeting dysfunctional mitochondria and optimizing delivery mechanisms for therapeutic agents. Continued research is essential to refine these approaches and fully understand the interplay between mitochondrial dynamics and aging.",

    "abstract": "In an aging society, unveiling new anti-aging strategies to prevent and combat aging-related diseases is of utmost importance. Mitochondria are the primary ATP production sites and key regulators of programmed cell death. Consequently, these highly dynamic organelles play a central role in maintaining tissue function, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a pivotal factor in the progressive age-related decline in cellular homeostasis and organ function. The current review examines recent advances in understanding the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and organ-specific aging. Thereby, we dissect molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial impairment associated with the deterioration of organ function, exploring the role of mitochondrial DNA, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, metabolic activity, damage-associated molecular patterns, biogenesis, turnover, and dynamics. We also highlight emerging therapeutic strategies in preclinical and clinical tests that are supposed to rejuvenate mitochondrial function, such as antioxidants, mitochondrial biogenesis stimulators, and modulators of mitochondrial turnover and dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss potential benefits and challenges associated with the use of these interventions, emphasizing the need for organ-specific approaches given the unique mitochondrial characteristics of different tissues. In conclusion, this review highlights the therapeutic potential of addressing mitochondrial dysfunction to mitigate organ-specific aging, focusing on the skin, liver, lung, brain, skeletal muscle, and lung, as well as on the reproductive, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Based on a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of mitochondria, innovative therapeutic strategies may be developed and optimized to combat biological aging and promote healthy aging across diverse organ systems.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota (GM) produces various molecules that regulate the physiological functionality of the brain through the gut-brain axis (GBA). Studies suggest that alteration in GBA may lead to the onset and progression of various neurological dysfunctions. Moreover, aging is one of the prominent causes that contribute to the alteration of GBA. With age, GM undergoes a shift in population size and species of microflora leading to changes in their secreted metabolites. These changes also hamper communications among the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal), ENS (enteric nervous system), and ANS (autonomic nervous system). A therapeutic intervention that has recently gained attention in improving health and maintaining communication between the gut and the brain is calorie restriction (CR), which also plays a critical role in autophagy and neurogenesis processes. However, its strict regime and lifelong commitment pose challenges. The need is to produce similar beneficial effects of CR without having its rigorous compliance. This led to an exploration of calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs) which could mimic CR's functions without limiting diet, providing long-term health benefits. CRMs ensure the efficient functioning of the GBA through gut bacteria and their metabolites i.e., short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and neurotransmitters. This is particularly beneficial for elderly individuals, as the GM deteriorates with age and the body's ability to digest the toxic accumulates declines. In this review, we have explored the beneficial effect of CRMs in extending lifespan by enhancing the beneficial bacteria and their effects on metabolite production, physiological conditions, and neurological dysfunctions including neurodegenerative disorders.",

Nevertheless, a direct link between their scavenging functions and the aging process has yet to be established.

    "title": "Consolidating multiple evolutionary theories of ageing suggests a need for new approaches to study genetic contributions to ageing decline.",
    "abstract": "Understanding mechanisms of ageing remains a complex challenge for biogerontologists, but recent adaptations of evolutionary ageing theories offer a compelling lens in which to view both age-related molecular and physiological deterioration. Ageing is commonly associated with progressive declines in biochemical and molecular processes resulting from damage accumulation, yet the role of continued developmental gene activation is less appreciated. Natural selection pressures are at their highest in youthful periods to modify gene expression towards maximising reproductive capacity. After sexual maturation, selective pressure diminishes, subjecting individuals to maladaptive pleiotropic gene functions that were once beneficial for developmental growth but become pathogenic later in life. Due to this selective 'shadowing' in ageing, mechanisms to counter such hyper/hypofunctional genes are unlikely to evolve. Interventions aimed at targeting gene hyper/hypofunction during ageing might, therefore, represent an attractive therapeutic strategy. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers a strong model for post-reproductive mechanistic and therapeutic investigations, yet studies examining the mechanisms of, and countermeasures against, ageing decline largely intervene from larval stages onwards. Importantly, however, lifespan extending conditions frequently impair early-life fitness and fail to correspondingly increase healthspan. Here, we consolidate multiple evolutionary theories of ageing and discuss data supporting hyper/hypofunctional changes at a global molecular and functional level in C. elegans, and how classical lifespan-extension mutations alter these dynamics. The relevance of such mutant models for exploring mechanisms of ageing are discussed, highlighting that post-reproductive gene optimisation represents a more translatable approach for C. elegans research that is not constrained by evolutionary trade-offs. Where some genetic mutations in C. elegans that promote late-life health map accordingly with healthy ageing in humans, other widely used genetic mutations that extend worm lifespan are associated with life-limiting pathologies in people. Lifespan has also become the gold standard for quantifying 'ageing', but we argue that gerospan compression (i.e., 'healthier' ageing) is an appropriate goal for anti-ageing research, the mechanisms of which appear distinct from those regulating lifespan alone. There is, therefore, an evident need to re-evaluate experimental approaches to study the role of hyper/hypofunctional genes in ageing in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades there has been a substantial rise in the adoption of diabetes therapeutic technology among children, adolescents and younger adults with type 1 diabetes, and its use is now also advocated for older individuals. Older people with diabetes are more prone to experience hypoglycaemia because of numerous predisposing factors and are at higher risk of hypoglycaemic events requiring third-party assistance as well as other adverse sequelae. Hypoglycaemia may also have long-term consequences, including cognitive impairment, frailty and disability. Diabetes in older people is often characterised by marked glucose variability related to age-associated changes such as variable appetite and levels of physical activity, comorbidities and polypharmacotherapy. Preventing hypoglycaemia and mitigating glucose excursions may have considerable positive impacts on physical and cognitive function and general well-being and may even prevent or improve frailty. Technology for older people includes continuous glucose monitoring systems, insulin pumps, automated insulin delivery systems and smart insulin pens. Clinical trials and real-world studies have shown that older people with diabetes benefit from technology in terms of glucose management, reductions in hypoglycaemic events, emergency department attendance and hospital admissions, and improvement in quality of life. However, ageing may bring physical impairments and other challenges that hinder the use of technology. Healthcare professionals should identify older adults with diabetes who may benefit from therapeutic technology and then adopt an individualised approach to education and follow-up for individuals and their caregivers. Future research should explore the impact of diabetes technology on outcomes relevant to older people with diabetes.",

Animal models of aging are the focus of this perspective, which discusses how experimental design can be optimized to inform and refine the development of translationally relevant measures and biomarkers of biological age. We provide recommendations to the field, including: the design of longitudinal studies in which subjects are deeply phenotyped via repeated multilevel behavioral/social/molecular assays; the need to consider sociobehavioral variables relevant for the species studied; and finally, the importance of assessing age of onset, severity of pathologies, and age-at-death.

    "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable and complex biological process involving multi-factorial mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical factor in the aging process, characterized by a decline in mitochondrial quality and activity, leading to aging and aging-related diseases. Therefore, mitochondria have become an attractive target in anti-aging therapies. Several senolytic drugs targeting mitochondria and antioxidant agents have been used in anti-aging research in the past few years. However, these strategies may cause adverse effects with long-term medication. In this extensive review, we propose \"mitochondrial transplantation,\" which transfers healthy mitochondria from donor cells to recipient cells to replace damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, as a new alternative strategy for treating mitochondrial dysfunction and aging-associated diseases. In this review, we introduce the contemporary landscape of mitochondrial transplantation, then discuss intensely the successful applications of mitochondrial transplantation therapy in aging diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular aging, and reproductive aging, highlighting its translational potential. Finally, we summarize and prospect the challenges and opportunities mitochondrial transplantation faces in anti-aging therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a crucial process of irreversible cell-cycle arrest, in which cells remain alive, but permanently unable to proliferate in response to distinct types of stressors. Accumulating evidence suggests that DNA damage builds over time and triggers DNA damage response signaling, leading to cellular senescence. Cellular senescence serves as a platform for the perpetuation of inflammatory responses and is central to numerous age-related diseases. Defects in DNA repair genes or senescence can cause premature aging disease. Therapeutic approaches limiting DNA damage or senescence contribute to a rescued phenotype of longevity and neuroprotection, thus suggesting a mechanistic interaction between DNA damage and senescence. Here, we offer a unique perspective on the crosstalk between the DNA damage response pathway and senescence as well as their contribution to age-related diseases. We further summarize recent progress on the mechanisms and therapeutics of senescence, address existing challenges, and offering new insights and future directions in the senescence field.",

    "abstract": "The use of housekeeping genes and proteins to normalize mRNA and protein levels in biomedical research has faced growing scrutiny. Researchers encounter challenges in determining the optimal frequency for running housekeeping proteins such as Î²-actin, Tubulin, and GAPDH for nuclear-encoded proteins, and Porin, HSP60, and TOM20 for mitochondrial proteins alongside experimental proteins. The regulation of these proteins varies with age, gender, disease progression, epitope nature, gel running conditions, and their reported sizes can differ among antibody suppliers. Additionally, anonymous readers have raised concerns about peer-reviewed and published articles, creating confusion and concern within the research and academic institutions. To clarify these matters, this minireview discusses the role of reference housekeeping proteins in Western blot analysis and outlines key considerations for their use as normalization controls. Instead of Western blotting of housekeeping proteins, staining of total proteins, using Amido Black and Coomassie Blue can be visualized the total protein content on a membrane. The reducing repeated Western blotting analysis of housekeeping proteins, will save resources, time and efforts and in turn increase the number of competitive grants from NIH and funding agencies. We also discussed the use of dot blots over traditional Western blots, when protein levels are low in rare tissues/specimens and cell lines. We sincerely hope that the facts, figures, and discussions presented in this article will clarify the current controversy regarding housekeeping protein(s) use, reuse, and functional aspects of housekeeping proteins. The contents presented in our article will be useful to students, scholars and researchers of all levels in cell biology, protein chemistry and mitochondrial research.",

Emerging studies emphasize cellular senescence as a key mechanism implicated in the pathobiology of age-related diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Cellular senescence, marked by antagonistic pleiotropy, and the complex interplay with immunity, are pivotal in comprehending many aspects of lung fibrosis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDance combines cultural and aesthetic elements with behaviors important for brain health, including physical activity, social engagement, and cognitive challenge. Therefore, dance could positively impact public health given the rapidly aging population, increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and lack of uptake of exercise in many older adults. Despite a high volume of literature, existing literature does not support evidence-based guidelines for dance to support healthy aging.ObjectiveTo conduct a scoping review of the dance intervention literature in older adults and provide information to facilitate a more consistent approach among scientists in designing dance interventions for older adults that stimulate physical and neurocognitive health adaptations.MethodsStudy characteristics (sample size, population, study design, outcomes, intervention details) were ascertained from 112 separate studies of dance reported in 127 papers that reported outcomes important for brain health (cardiorespiratory fitness, balance and mobility, cognition, mood, and quality of life).ResultsHigh heterogeneity across studies was evident. Class frequency ranged from <â1 to 5 classes per week, class length from 30-120 minutes, and intervention duration from 2 weeks to 18 months. Studies often did not randomize participants, had small (<â30) sample sizes, and used varied comparator conditions. Over 50 tests of cognition, 40 dance forms, and 30 tests of mobility were identified.ConclusionsBased on these results, important future directions are establishing common data elements, developing intervention mapping and mechanistic modeling, and testing dosing parameters to strengthen and focus trial design of future studies and generate evidence-based guidelines for dance.",

    "abstract": "Aging, a natural biological process, presents challenges in maintaining physiological well-being and is associated with increased vulnerability to diseases. Addressing aging mechanisms is crucial for developing effective preventive and therapeutic strategies against age-related ailments. Rosmarinus officinalis L. is a medicinal herb widely used in traditional medicine, containing diverse bioactive compounds that have been studied for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are associated with potential health benefits. Using network pharmacology, this study investigates the anti-aging function and underlying mechanisms of R. officinalis. Through network pharmacology analysis, the top 10 hub genes were identified, including TNF, CTNNB1, JUN, MTOR, SIRT1, and others associated with the anti-aging effects. This analysis revealed a comprehensive network of interactions, providing a holistic perspective on the multi-target mechanism underlying Rosemary's anti-aging properties. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the relevant biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components involved in treating aging-related conditions. KEGG pathway analysis shows that anti-aging targets of R. officinalis involved endocrine resistance, pathways in cancer, and relaxin signaling pathways, among others, indicating multifaceted mechanisms. Genes like MAPK1, MMP9, and JUN emerged as significant players. These findings enhance our understanding of R. officinalis's potential in mitigating aging-related disorders through multi-target effects on various biological processes and pathways. Such approaches may reduce the risk of failure in single-target and symptom-based drug discovery and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Solid gastrointestinal tumors often respond poorly to immunotherapy for the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), which is exacerbated by immune system alterations. Immunosenescence is the process of increased diversification of immune genes due to aging and other factors, leading to a decrease in the recognition function of the immune system. This process involves immune organs, immune cells, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The most fundamental change is DNA damage, resulting in TME remodeling. The main manifestations are worsening inflammation, increased immunosuppressive SASP production, decreased immune cell antitumor activity, and the accumulation of tumor-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, making antitumor therapy less effective. Senotherapy strategies to remove senescent cells and block key senescence processes can have synergistic effects with other treatments. This review focuses on immunoenescence and its impact on the solid TME. We characterize the immunosenescent TME and discuss future directions for antitumor therapies targeting senescence.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic oncogenic mechanisms and properties of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been extensively investigated. Primary features of the TME include metabolic reprogramming, hypoxia, chronic inflammation, and tumor immunosuppression. Previous studies suggest that senescence-associated secretory phenotypes that mediate intercellular information exchange play a role in the dynamic evolution of the TME. Specifically, hypoxic adaptation, metabolic dysregulation, and phenotypic shifts in immune cells regulated by cellular senescence synergistically contribute to the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and chronic inflammation, thereby promoting the progression of tumor events. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the processes by which cellular senescence regulates the dynamic evolution of the tumor-adapted TME, with focus on the complex mechanisms underlying the relationship between senescence and changes in the biological functions of tumor cells. The available findings suggest that components of the TME collectively contribute to the progression of tumor events.

    "abstract": "The treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is considered to be a longâstanding challenge. Conventional treatments for metastatic PCa, such as radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy and androgen receptorâtargeted therapy, induce senescence of PCa cells to a certain extent. While senescent cells can impede tumor growth through the restriction of cell proliferation and increasing immune clearance, the senescent microenvironment may concurrently stimulate the secretion of a senescenceâassociated secretory phenotype and diminish immune cell function, which promotes PCa recurrence and metastasis. Resistance to established therapies is the primary obstacle in treating metastatic PCa as it can lead to progression towards an incurable state of disease. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that underly the progression of PCa is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. The present study reviews the phenomenon of treatmentâinduced senescence in PCa, the dual role of senescence in PCa treatments and the mechanisms through which senescence promotes PCa metastasis. Furthermore, the present review discusses potential therapeutic strategies to target the aforementioned processes with the aim of providing insights into the evolving therapeutic landscape for the treatment of metastatic PCa.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, through integrating external and internal signals, facilitating gene transcription and protein translation, as well as by regulating mitochondria and autophagy functions. mTOR kinase operates within two distinct protein complexes known as mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which engage separate downstream signaling pathways impacting diverse cellular processes. Although mTORC1 has been extensively studied as a pro-proliferative factor and a pro-aging hub if activated aberrantly, mTORC2 received less attention, particularly regarding its implication in aging regulation. However, recent studies brought increasing evidence or clues for us, which implies the associations of mTORC2 with aging, as the genetic elimination of unique subunits of mTORC2, such as RICTOR, has been shown to alleviate aging progression in comparison to mTORC1 inhibition. In this review, we first summarized the basic characteristics of mTORC2, including its protein architecture and signaling network. We then focused on reviewing the molecular signaling regulation of mTORC2 in cellular senescence and organismal aging, and proposed the multifaceted regulatory characteristics under senescent and nonsenescent contexts. Next, we outlined the research progress of mTOR inhibitors in the field of antiaging and discussed future prospects and challenges.

This delicate orchestration is susceptible to disruption by factors such as aging, diabetes, and obesity, which can impair the BM niche and consequently affect haematopoiesis. Genetic mutations in Tet2, Dnmt3a, Asxl1, and Jak2 are known to give rise to clonal haematopoiesis of intermediate potential (CHIP), a condition linked to age-related haematological malignancies. Despite these insights, the exact roles of circadian rhythms, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), sterile inflammation, and the complement cascade on various BM niche cells remain inadequately understood. Further research is needed to elucidate how BM niche cells contribute to these malignancies through neural regulation and their potential in the development of gene-corrected stem cells. This literature review describes the updated functional aspects of BM niche cells in haematopoiesis within the context of haematological malignancies, with a particular focus on neural signaling and the potential of radiomitigators in acute radiation syndrome. Additionally, it underscores the pressing need for technological advancements in stem cell-based therapies to alleviate the impacts of immunological stressors. Recent studies have illuminated the microheterogeneity and temporal stochasticity of niche cells within the BM during haematopoiesis, emphasizing the updated roles of neural signaling and immunosurveillance.

Investigating the molecular underpinnings of aging is crucial to identify geroprotectors, precisely quantify biological age, and propose healthy longevity approaches. This review explores pathways that are currently being investigated as intervention targets and aging biomarkers spanning molecular, cellular, and systemic dimensions. Interventions that target these hallmarks may ameliorate the aging process, with some progressing to clinical trials. Biomarkers of these hallmarks are used to estimate biological aging and risk of aging-associated disease. Utilizing aging biomarkers, biological aging clocks can be constructed that predict a state of abnormal aging, age-related diseases, and increased mortality. Biological age estimation can therefore provide the basis for a fine-grained risk stratification by predicting all-cause mortality well ahead of the onset of specific diseases, thus offering a window for intervention. Yet, despite technological advancements, challenges persist due to individual variability and the dynamic nature of these biomarkers. Addressing this requires longitudinal studies for robust biomarker identification. Overall, utilizing the hallmarks of aging to discover new drug targets and develop new biomarkers opens new frontiers in medicine.

While human senescence was once regarded as an immutable and inexorable phenomenon, impervious to interventions, the emerging field of geroscience now offers innovative approaches to aging, holding the promise of extending the period of healthspan in humans. Understanding the intricate links between aging and pathologies is essential in addressing the challenges presented by aging populations. A substantial body of evidence indicates shared mechanisms and pathways contributing to the development and progression of various ARDs. Consequently, novel interventions targeting the intrinsic mechanisms of aging have the potential to delay the onset of diverse pathological conditions, thereby extending healthspan. In this narrative review, we discuss the most promising methods and interventions aimed at modulating aging, which harbor the potential to mitigate ARDs in the future. We also outline the complexity of senescence and review recent empirical evidence to identify rational strategies for promoting healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms controlling platelet function is crucial for exploring potential therapeutic targets related to atherothrombotic pathologies and primary hemostasis disorders. Our research, which focuses on the role of platelet mitochondria and Ca2+ fluxes in platelet activation, the formation of the procoagulant phenotype, and thrombosis, has significant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Traditionally, Ca2+-dependent cellular signaling has been recognized as a determinant process throughout the platelet activation, controlled primarily by store-operated Ca2+ entry and the PLC-PKC signaling pathway. However, despite the accumulated knowledge of these regulatory mechanisms, the effectiveness of therapy based on various commonly used antiplatelet drugs (such as acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel, among others) has faced challenges due to bleeding risks and reduced efficacy associated with the phenomenon of high platelet reactivity. Recent evidence suggests that platelet mitochondria could play a fundamental role in these aspects through Ca2+-dependent mechanisms linked to apoptosis and forming a procoagulant phenotype. In this context, the present review describes the latest advances regarding the role of platelet mitochondria and Ca2+ fluxes in platelet activation, the formation of the procoagulant phenotype, and thrombosis.",

During aging, dynamic adaptations in the functionality and structure of the biological systems occur. Consistently, immunosenescence (IS) accounts for polydysfunctions within the lymphocyte subsets, and the onset of a basal but persistent systemic inflammation characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. There is an emerging consensus about a causative link between such hallmarks and increased susceptibility to morbidities and mortality, however the role of IS in solid organ transplantation (SOT) remains loosely addressed. Dissecting the immune-architecture of immunologically-privileged sites may prompt novel insights to extend allograft survival.

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration, known as the progressive loss of neurons in terms of their structure and function, is the principal pathophysiological change found in the majority of brain-related disorders. Ageing has been considered the most well-established risk factor in most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is currently no effective treatment or cure for these diseases; the approved therapeutic options to date are only for palliative care. Ageing and neurodegenerative diseases are closely intertwined; reversing the aspects of brain ageing could theoretically mitigate age-related neurodegeneration. Ever since the regenerative properties of young blood on aged tissues came to light, substantial efforts have been focused on identifying and characterizing the circulating factors in the young and old systemic milieu that may attenuate or accentuate brain ageing and neurodegeneration. Later studies discovered the superiority of old plasma dilution in tissue rejuvenation, which is achieved through a molecular reset of the systemic proteome. These findings supported the use of therapeutic blood exchange for the treatment of degenerative diseases in older individuals. The first objective of this article is to explore the rejuvenating properties of blood-based therapies in the ageing brains and their therapeutic effects on AD. Then, we also look into the clinical applications, various limitations, and challenges associated with blood-based therapies for AD patients.",

Notably, emotional and cognitive symptoms co-occur across multiple age-associated conditions like normal aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. While the intricate interplay underlying this relationship remains poorly understood, this article highlights the possibility that an imbalance between full-length (TrkB.FL) and truncated (TrkB.T1) isoforms of tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB in the neurotrophic system may significantly affect age-associated emotional and cognitive functions, by altering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, integral to neuronal health, cognitive functions and mood regulation. While the contribution of this imbalance to pathogenesis awaits full elucidation, this review evaluates its potential mediating role, linking emotional and cognitive decline across age-related disorders The interplay between TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL isoforms may be considered as a pivotal shared regulator underlying this complex relationship. The current review aims to synthesize current knowledge on TrkB isoform imbalance, specifically its contribution to age-related cognitive decline and mood disorders. By examining shared pathogenic pathways between aging, cognitive decline, and mood disorders through the lens of TrkB signaling, this review uncovers potential therapeutic targets not previously considered, offering a fresh perspective on combating age-related mental health issues as well as cognitive deficits.",

This interplay is significant amidst an aging global demographic. The review explores the classical pathologies of AD, including amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau, and their potential role in the genesis of epilepsy. It also delves into the imbalance of glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid activities, a key mechanism in epilepsy that may be influenced by AD pathology. The impact of age of onset on comorbidity is examined, with early-onset AD and Down syndrome presenting higher risks of epilepsy. The review suggests that epilepsy might precede cognitive symptoms in AD, indicating a complex interaction. Sleep modulation is highlighted as a factor, with sleep disturbances potentially contributing to AD progression. The necessity for cautious medication management is emphasized due to the cognitive effects of certain antiepileptic drugs. Animal models are recognized for their importance in understanding the relationship between AD and epilepsy, though creating fully representative models presents a challenge. The review concludes by noting the efficacy of medications such as lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and memantine in managing both conditions and suggests the ketogenic diet and cannabidiol as emerging treatment options, warranting further investigation for comprehensive patient care strategies.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally known for managing blood sugar, GLP-1, a gut hormone, is emerging as a potential key to both lengthening lifespan and combating age-related ailments. While widely recognized for its role in blood sugar control, GLP-1 is increasingly recognized for its diverse effects on various biological pathways beyond glucose metabolism. Research across organisms and humans suggests that activating GLP-1 receptors significantly impacts cellular processes linked to aging. Its ability to boost mitochondrial function, enhance cellular stress resistance, and quell inflammation hints at its wider influence on aging mechanisms. This intricate interplay between GLP-1 and longevity appears to act through multiple pathways. One key effect is its ability to modulate insulin sensitivity, potentially curbing age-related metabolic issues like type 2 diabetes. Its neuroprotective properties also make it a promising candidate for addressing age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, preclinical studies using GLP-1 analogs or agonists have shown promising results in extending lifespan and improving healthspan in various model organisms. These findings provide a compelling rationale for exploring GLP-1-based interventions in humans to extend healthy aging. However, despite the exciting therapeutic prospects of GLP-1 in promoting longevity, challenges remain. Determining optimal dosages, establishing long-term safety profiles, and investigating potential adverse effects require comprehensive clinical investigations before we can confidently translate these findings to humans. This article emphasises the wide applicability of GLP-1.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in the United States. However, disparities in CVD-related morbidity and mortality exist as marginalized racial and ethnic groups are generally at higher risk for CVDs (Black Americans, Indigenous People, South and Southeast Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders) and/or development of traditional CVD risk factors (groups above plus Hispanics/Latinos) relative to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). In this comprehensive review, we outline emerging evidence suggesting these groups experience accelerated arterial dysfunction, including vascular endothelial dysfunction and large elastic artery stiffening, a nontraditional CVD risk factor that may predict risk of CVDs in these groups with advancing age. Adverse exposures to social determinants of health (SDOH), specifically lower socioeconomic status (SES), are exacerbated in most of these groups (except South Asians-higher SES) and may be a potential mediator of accelerated arterial aging. SES negatively influences the ability of marginalized racial and ethnic groups to meet aerobic exercise guidelines, the first-line strategy to improve arterial function, due to increased barriers, such as time and financial constraints, lack of motivation, facility access, and health education, to performing conventional aerobic exercise. Thus, identifying alternative interventions to conventional aerobic exercise that 1) overcome these common barriers and 2) target the biological mechanisms of aging to improve arterial function may be an effective, alternative method to aerobic exercise to ameliorate accelerated arterial aging and reduce CVD risk. Importantly, dedicated efforts are needed to assess these strategies in randomized-controlled clinical trials in these marginalized racial and ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "Aging and regeneration represent complex biological phenomena that have long captivated the scientific community. To fully comprehend these processes, it is essential to investigate molecular dynamics through a lens that encompasses both spatial and temporal dimensions. Conventional omics methodologies, such as genomics and transcriptomics, have been instrumental in identifying critical molecular facets of aging and regeneration. However, these methods are somewhat limited, constrained by their spatial resolution and their lack of capacity to dynamically represent tissue alterations. The advent of emerging spatiotemporal multi-omics approaches, encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics, furnishes comprehensive insights into these intricate molecular dynamics. These sophisticated techniques facilitate accurate delineation of molecular patterns across an array of cells, tissues, and organs, thereby offering an in-depth understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at play. This review meticulously examines the significance of spatiotemporal multi-omics in the realms of aging and regeneration research. It underscores how these methodologies augment our comprehension of molecular dynamics, cellular interactions, and signaling pathways. Initially, the review delineates the foundational principles underpinning these methods, followed by an evaluation of their recent applications within the field. The review ultimately concludes by addressing the prevailing challenges and projecting future advancements in the field.

Cannabis-like compounds (cannabinoids) are reported to improve quality of life and general well-being in human trials, and there is increasing preclinical research highlighting that they have anti-ageing activity. Moreover, preclinical evidence suggests that endogenous cannabinoids regulate ageing processes. Here, we review the anti-ageing effects of the cannabinoids in various model systems, including the most extensively studied nematode model, Caenorhabditis elegans. These studies highlight that the cannabinoids lengthen healthspan and lifespan, with emerging evidence that they may also hinder the development of cellular senescence. The non-psychoactive cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) shows particular promise, with mechanistic studies demonstrating it may work through autophagy induction and activation of antioxidative systems. Furthermore, CBD improves healthspan parameters such as diminishing age-related behavioural dysfunction in models of both healthy and accelerated ageing. Translation into mammalian systems provides an important next step. Moreover, looking beyond CBD, future studies could probe the multitude of other cannabis constituents for their anti-ageing activity.",

    "title": "A new perspective on prostate cancer treatment: the interplay between cellular senescence and treatment resistance.",
    "abstract": "The emergence of resistance to prostate cancer (PCa) treatment, particularly to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), has posed a significant challenge in the field of PCa management. Among the therapeutic options for PCa, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy are commonly used modalities. However, these therapeutic approaches, while inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, may also trigger stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). Cellular senescence, an entropy-driven transition from an ordered to a disordered state, ultimately leading to cell growth arrest, exhibits a dual role in PCa treatment. On one hand, senescent tumor cells may withdraw from the cell cycle, thereby reducing tumor growth rate and exerting a positive effect on treatment. On the other hand, senescent tumor cells may secrete a plethora of cytokines, growth factors and proteases that can affect neighboring tumor cells, thereby exerting a negative impact on treatment. This review explores how radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy trigger SIPS and the nuanced impact of senescent tumor cells on PCa treatment. Additionally, we aim to identify novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in PCa treatment, thereby enhancing patient outcomes.",

Cellular senescence, which acts as a response to injury and can the release of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs). These SASPs release various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, remodeling the TME. This continual development of a senescent environment could be associated with chronic inflammation and immunosuppressive TME. Additionally, SASPs could influence the phenotype and function of macrophages, leading to the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This contributes to tumor proliferation and metastasis in the senescent microenvironment, working in tandem with immune regulation, angiogenesis, and therapeutic resistance. This comprehensive review covers the evolving nature of the senescent microenvironment, macrophages, and TAMs in tumor development. We also explored the links between chronic inflammation, immunosuppressive TME, cellular senescence, and macrophages. Moreover, we compiled various tumor-specific treatment strategies centered on cellular senescence and the current challenges in cellular senescence research. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of macrophages and the senescent microenvironment in tumor progression and advance the development of targeted tumor therapies.",

This systematic review aims to gather data from studies that present health indicators establishing the connection between climate change and the physical and mental health of the older population (â¥ 65 years), who experience a heightened vulnerability to the impacts of climate change when compared to other age cohorts. This review was conducted according to the PICO strategy and following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Greenfile) were searched for articles from 2015 to 2022. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria,nineteen studies were included. The findings indicated that various climate change phenomena are associated with an elevated risk of mortality and morbidity outcomes in older adults. These included cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and mental diseases, along with physical injuries. Notably, the impact of climate change was influenced by gender, socioeconomic status, education level, and age-vulnerability factors. Climate change directly affected the health of older adults through ambient temperature variability, extreme and abnormal temperatures, strong winds, sea temperature variability, extreme El NiÃ±o-southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and droughts, and indirectly by air pollution resulting from wildfires. This review presents further evidence confirming that climate change significantly impacts the health and well-being of older adults. It highlights the urgency for implementing effective strategies to facilitate adaptation and mitigation, enhancing the overall quality of life for all individuals.",

    "abstract": "Globally, the human population is aging, with an increased proportion of people in \"old age\" (over 60âyears). This trend leads to a growing demand in aging research, stimulating studies in animal models such as mice, fish, and invertebrates. Recently, we published a research summary on the aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in C57BL/6 mice based on 12 gene expression datasets. Here, I discuss in greater detail the added value of taking an integrated view, rather than considering each publication separately, to determine genes involved in aging. Considerable variation exists between lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes in HSCs, comparing young and old mice. This variation can result from factors such as inconsistent definitions of \"young\" and \"old\", technical variations and variations between laboratory mouse strains. We previously demonstrated that the variation between gene lists could be circumvented by forming a unified list of DE genes-the \"aging list\"-with citation indexes attached. The most frequently detected DE genes [approximately 200 most cited, which we named the \"aging signature\" (AS)] were highly consistent across publications. Gene Ontology classification of the AS list identified additional sources of variation between studies: one comes from the specifics of how the data are collected and analyzed; another comes from inconsistencies between how we define the gene categories. As discussed, overcoming these variations is the next challenge toward an integral approach to our systematic knowledge of the aging process.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is associated with widespread physiological changes prominent within all tissues, including skeletal muscle and the brain, which lead to a decline in physical function. To tackle the growing health and economic burdens associated with an ageing population, the concept of healthy ageing has become a major research priority. Changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial characteristics have been suggested to make an important contribution to the reductions in skeletal muscle function with age, and age-related changes in mitochondrial content, respiratory function, morphology, and mitochondrial DNA have previously been reported. However, not all studies report changes in mitochondrial characteristics with ageing, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that physical activity (or inactivity) throughout life is a confounding factor when interpreting age-associated changes. Given that physical activity is a potent stimulus for inducing beneficial adaptations to mitochondrial characteristics, delineating the influence of physical activity on the changes in skeletal muscle that occur with age is complicated. This review aims to summarise our current understanding and knowledge gaps regarding age-related changes to mitochondrial characteristics within skeletal muscle, as well as to provide some novel insights into brain mitochondria, and to propose avenues of future research and targeted interventions. Furthermore, where possible, we incorporate discussions of the modifying effects of physical activity, exercise, and training status, to purported age-related changes in mitochondrial characteristics.",

From infancy to later stages of adulthood, healthy individuals witness dynamic shifts in gut microbiota composition. This microbial community is associated with tissue and organ function deterioration (e.g., brain, bones, muscles, immune system, vascular system) and heightened risk of age-related diseases. Thus, we present a narrative review of the aging gut microbiome in both healthy and unhealthy aging contexts. Additionally, we explore the potential for adjustments to physical health based on gut microbiome analysis and how targeting the gut microbiome can potentially slow down the aging process.",

    "abstract": "Aging refers to complete deterioration of physiological integrity and function. By midcentury, adults over 60 years of age and children under 15 years will begin to outnumber people in working age. This shift will bring multiple global challenges for economy, health, and society. Eventually, aging is a natural process playing a vital function in growth and development during pediatric stage, maturation during adult stage, and functional depletion. Tissues experience negative consequences with enhanced genomic instability, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and decline in performance on cognitive tasks. As brain ages, its volume decreases, neurons & glia get inflamed, vasculature becomes less developed, blood pressure increases with a risk of stroke, ischemia, and cognitive deficits. Diminished cellular functions leads to progressive reduction in functional and emotional capacity with higher possibility of disease and finally death. This review overviews cellular as well as molecular aspects of aging, biological pathway related to accelerated brain aging, and strategies minimizing cognitive aging. Age-related changes include altered bioenergetics, decreased neuroplasticity and flexibility, aberrant neural activity, deregulated Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons, buildup of reactive oxygen species, and neuro-inflammation. Unprecedented progress has been achieved in recent studies, particularly in terms of how herbal or natural substances affect genetic pathways and biological functions that have been preserved through evolution. Herein, the present work provides an overview of ageing and age-related disorders and explore the molecular mechanisms that underlie therapeutic effects of herbal and natural chemicals on neuropathological signs of brain aging.",

    "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases in men and in women. However, not all people age at the same rate and those who are aging rapidly are considered frail, compared with their fit counterparts. Frailty is an important clinical challenge because those who are frail are more likely to develop and die from illnesses, including cardiovascular diseases, than fit people of the same age. This increase in susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases in older individuals might occur as the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the aging process facilitate structural and functional damage in the heart. Consistent with this, recent studies in murine frailty models have provided strong evidence that maladaptive cardiac remodelling in older mice is the most pronounced in mice with a high level of frailty. For example, there is evidence that ventricular hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction increase as frailty increases in aging mice. Additionally, fibrosis and slowing of conduction in the sinoatrial node and atria are proportional to the level of frailty. These modifications could predispose frail older adults to diseases like heart failure and atrial fibrillation. This preclinical work also raises the possibility that emerging interventions designed to \"treat frailty\" might also treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases. These findings might help to explain why frail older people are most likely to develop these disorders as they age.",

The continuous accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs) in the body leads to the development of aging and age-related diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and osteoarthritis). In the face of the growing challenge of aging and age-related diseases, several compounds have received widespread attention for their potential to target SnCs. As a result, senolytics (compounds that selectively eliminate SnCs) and senomorphics (compounds that alter intercellular communication and modulate the behavior of SnCs) have become hot research topics in the field of anti-aging. In addition, strategies such as combination therapies and immune-based approaches have also made significant progress in the field of anti-aging therapy. In this article, we discuss the latest research on anti-aging targeting SnCs and gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action and impact of different anti-aging strategies on aging and age-related diseases, with the aim of providing more effective references and therapeutic ideas for clinical anti-aging treatment in the face of the ever-grave challenges of aging and age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization recently declared 2021-2030 the decade of healthy aging. Such emphasis on healthy aging requires an understanding of the biologic challenges aging populations face. Physical frailty is a syndrome of vulnerability that puts a subset of older adults at high risk for adverse health outcomes including functional and cognitive decline, falls, hospitalization, and mortality. The physiology driving physical frailty is complex with age-related biological changes, dysregulated stress response systems, chronic inflammatory pathway activation, and altered energy metabolism all likely contributing. Indeed, a series of recent studies suggests circulating metabolomic distinctions can be made between frail and non-frail older adults. For example, marked restrictions on glycolytic and mitochondrial energy production have been independently observed in frail older adults and collectively appear to yield a reliance on the highly fatigable ATP-phosphocreatine (PCr) energy system. Further, there is evidence that age-associated impairments in the primary ATP generating systems (glycolysis, TCA cycle, electron transport) yield cumulative deficits and fail to adequately support the ATP-PCr system. This in turn may acutely contribute to several major components of the physical frailty phenotype including muscular fatigue, weakness, slow walking speed and, over time, result in low physical activity and accelerate reductions in lean body mass. This review describes specific age-associated metabolic declines and how they can collectively lead to metabolic inflexibility, ATP-PCr reliance, and the development of physical frailty. Further investigation remains necessary to understand the etiology of age-associated metabolic deficits and develop targeted preventive strategies that maintain robust metabolic health in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Modeling complex eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma poses significant challenges, since these conditions depend highly on age-related changes that occur over several decades, with many contributing factors remaining unknown. Although both diseases exhibit a relatively high heritability of >50%, a large proportion of individuals carrying AMD- or glaucoma-associated genetic risk variants will never develop these diseases. Furthermore, several environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to and modulate the pathogenesis and progression of AMD and glaucoma. Several strategies replicate the impact of genetic risk variants, pathobiological pathways and environmental and lifestyle factors in AMD and glaucoma in mice and other species. In this review we will primarily discuss the most commonly available mouse models, which have and will likely continue to improve our understanding of the pathobiology of age-related eye diseases. Uncertainties persist whether small animal models can truly recapitulate disease progression and vision loss in patients, raising doubts regarding their usefulness when testing novel gene or drug therapies. We will elaborate on concerns that relate to shorter lifespan, body size and allometries, lack of macula and a true lamina cribrosa, as well as absence and sequence disparities of certain genes and differences in their chromosomal location in mice. Since biological, rather than chronological, age likely predisposes an organism for both glaucoma and AMD, more rapidly aging organisms like small rodents may open up possibilities that will make research of these diseases more timely and financially feasible. On the other hand, due to the above-mentioned anatomical and physiological features, as well as pharmacokinetic and -dynamic differences small animal models are not ideal to study the natural progression of vision loss or the efficacy and safety of novel therapies. In this context, we will also discuss the advantages and pitfalls of alternative models that include larger species, such as non-human primates and rabbits, patient-derived retinal organoids, and human organ donor eyes.",

Such biomarkers could predict aging-related outcomes and could serve as surrogate endpoints for the evaluation of interventions promoting healthy aging and longevity. However, no consensus exists on how biomarkers of aging should be validated before their translation to the clinic. Here, we review current efforts to evaluate the predictive validity of omic biomarkers of aging in population studies, discuss challenges in comparability and generalizability and provide recommendations to facilitate future validation of biomarkers of aging. Finally, we discuss how systematic validation can accelerate clinical translation of biomarkers of aging and their use in gerotherapeutic clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Shoulder pain and disabilities are prevalent issues among the elderly population, with rotator cuff tear (RCT) being one of the leading causes. Although surgical treatment has shown some success,Â high postoperative retear rates remain a great challenge, particularly in elderly patients. Aging-related degeneration of muscle, tendon, tendon-to-bone enthesis, and bone plays a critical role in the development and prognosis of RCT. Studies have demonstrated that aging worsens muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration, alters tendon structure and biomechanical properties, exacerbates enthesis degeneration, and reduces bone density. Although recent researches have contributed to understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of aging-related RCT, a comprehensive systematic review of this topic is still lacking. Therefore, this article aims to present a review of the pathophysiological changes and their clinical significance, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying aging-related RCT, with the goal of shedding light on new therapeutic approaches to reduce the occurrence of aging-related RCT and improve postoperative prognosis in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Dietary restriction and fasting have been recognized for their beneficial effects on health and lifespan and their potential application in managing chronic metabolic diseases. However, long-term adherence to strict dietary restrictions and prolonged fasting poses challenges for most individuals and may lead to unhealthy rebound eating habits, negatively affecting overall health. As a result, a periodic fasting-mimicking diet (PFMD), involving cycles of fasting for 2 or more days while ensuring basic nutritional needs are met within a restricted caloric intake, has gained widespread acceptance. Current research indicates that a PFMD can promote stem cell regeneration, suppress inflammation, extend the health span of rodents, and improve metabolic health, among other effects. In various disease populations such as patients with diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, a PFMD has shown efficacy in alleviating disease symptoms and improving relevant markers. After conducting an extensive analysis of available research on the PFMD, it is evident that its advantages and potential applications are comparable to other fasting methods. Consequently, it is proposed in this review that a PFMD has the potential to fully replace water-only or very-low-energy fasting regimens and holds promise for application across multiple diseases.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit for the fountain of youth has long been a fascination amongst scientists and humanity. Ageing is broadly characterized by a cellular decline with increased susceptibility to age-related diseases, being intimately associated with epigenetic modifications. Recently, reprogramming-induced rejuvenation strategies have begun to greatly alter longevity research not only to tackle age-related defects but also to possibly reverse the cellular ageing process. Hence, in this review, we highlight the major epigenetic changes during ageing and the state-of-art of the current emerging epigenetic reprogramming strategies leveraging on transcription factors. Notably, partial reprogramming enables the resetting of the ageing clock without erasing cellular identity. Promising chemical-based rejuvenation strategies harnessing small molecules, including DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors are also discussed. Moreover, in parallel to longevity interventions, the foundations of epigenetic clocks for accurate ageing assessment and evaluation of reprogramming approaches are briefly presented. Going further, with such scientific breakthroughs, we are witnessing a rise in the longevity biotech industry aiming to extend the health span and ideally achieve human rejuvenation one day. In this context, we overview the main scenarios proposed for the future of the socio-economic and ethical challenges associated with such an emerging field. Ultimately, this review aims to inspire future research on interventions that promote healthy ageing for all.",

Owing to limitations in studying the aging process, including a lack of adequate quantitative measurements, its mechanistic basis remains a subject of debate.

Many aging-related changes have been observed and touted as drivers of aging, including molecular changes in the genome, telomeres, mitochondria, epigenome and proteins and cellular changes affecting stem cells, the immune system and senescent cell buildup. Determining which changes are drivers and not passengers of aging remains a challenge, however, and I discuss how animal models and human genetic studies have been used empirically to infer causality. Overall, our understanding of the drivers of human aging is still inadequate; yet with a global aging population, elucidating the causes of aging has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research.",

The objectives of our study are to explore the effect of human aging on RBC indices, the strengths, therapeutic interventions, challenges, and future directions for using RBCs as a biomarker. Two online databases, PubMed and ScienceDirect, were used to search relevant studies using \"RBCs as biomarkers of human aging,\" \"red blood cells [MeSH Terms] AND biomarkers [MeSH Terms] AND human aging [MeSH Terms],\" and \"erythrocytes and human aging\" as keywords. A total of 474 studies were identified, and after the removal of duplicates, excluding studies based on title, abstract, or full text, 74 studies and 48 additional studies found through cross-referencing were included in this systematic review. Based on the evidence, we concluded that RBC indices such as hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, RBC distribution width, RBC membrane, oxidative stress, and metabolism change with human aging. Several studies have applied therapeutic interventions to RBCs, including dietary supplementation, phytochemicals, nanoparticles, and physical activity, to mitigate aging and related outcomes. Hence, the quality of life for older people and healthy aging can be improved by further investigating the RBC parameters, molecular mechanisms, and their implications for age-related health consequences.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Aging is a complex process associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including thrombosis. This review summarizes age-related prothrombotic mechanisms in clinical settings of thromboembolism, focusing on the role of fibrin structure and function modified by oxidative stress. Recent Advances: Aging affects blood coagulation and fibrinolysis via multiple mechanisms, including enhanced oxidative stress, with an imbalance in the oxidant/antioxidant mechanisms, leading to loss of function and accumulation of oxidized proteins, including fibrinogen. Age-related prothrombotic alterations are multifactorial involving enhanced platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and changes in coagulation factors and inhibitors. Formation of more compact fibrin clot networks displaying impaired susceptibility to fibrinolysis represents a novel mechanism, which might contribute to atherothrombosis and venous thrombosis. Alterations to fibrin clot structure/function are at least in part modulated by post-translational modifications of fibrinogen and other proteins involved in thrombus formation, with a major impact of carbonylation. Fibrin clot properties are also involved in the efficacy and safety of therapy with oral anticoagulants, statins, and/or aspirin. Critical Issues: Since a prothrombotic state is observed in very elderly individuals free of diseases associated with thromboembolism, the actual role of activated blood coagulation in health remains elusive. It is unclear to what extent oxidative modifications of coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins, in particular fibrinogen, contribute to a prothrombotic state in healthy aging. Future Directions: Ongoing studies will show whether novel therapies that may alter oxidative stress and fibrin characteristics are beneficial to prevent atherosclerosis and thromboembolic events associated with aging.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Mitochondria are eukaryotic organelles with various essential functions. They are both the source and the targets of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Different branches of a mitochondrial quality control system (mQCS), such as ROS balancing, degradation of damaged proteins, or whole mitochondria, can mitigate the adverse effects of ROS stress. However, the capacity of mQCS is limited. Overwhelming this capacity leads to dysfunctions and aging. Strategies to interfere into mitochondria-dependent human aging with the aim to increase the healthy period of life, the health span, rely on the precise knowledge of mitochondrial functions. Experimental models such as Podospora anserina, a filamentous fungus with a clear mitochondrial aging etiology, proved to be instrumental to reach this goal. Recent Advances: Investigations of the P. anserina mQCS revealed that it is constituted by a complex network of different branches. Moreover, mitochondrial architecture and lipid homeostasis emerged to affect aging. Critical Issues: The regulation of the mQCS is only incompletely understood. Details about the involved signaling molecules and interacting pathways remain to be elucidated. Moreover, most of the currently generated experimental data were generated in well-controlled experiments that do not reflect the constantly changing natural life conditions and bear the danger to miss relevant aspects leading to incorrect conclusions. Future Directions: In P. anserina, the precise impact of redox signaling as well as of molecular damaging for aging remains to be defined. Moreover, natural fluctuation of environmental conditions needs to be considered to generate a realistic picture of aging mechanisms as they developed during evolution.",

    "abstract": "Vascular ageing, characterized by structural and functional changes in blood vessels of which arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction are key components, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and other age-related diseases. As the global population continues to age, understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate vascular ageing becomes crucial for improving cardiovascular health outcomes. Therefore, this review provides an overview of the current knowledge on pharmacological modulation of vascular ageing, highlighting key strategies and promising therapeutic targets. Several molecular pathways have been identified as central players in vascular ageing, including oxidative stress and inflammation, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, cellular senescence, macroautophagy, extracellular matrix remodelling, calcification, and gasotransmitter-related signalling. Pharmacological and dietary interventions targeting these pathways have shown potential in ameliorating age-related vascular changes. Nevertheless, the development and application of drugs targeting vascular ageing is complicated by various inherent challenges and limitations, such as certain preclinical methodological considerations, interactions with exercise training and sex/gender-related differences, which should be taken into account. Overall, pharmacological modulation of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness as hallmarks of vascular ageing, holds great promise for improving cardiovascular health in the ageing population. Nonetheless, further research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize the efficacy and safety of these interventions for clinical translation.",

In this review, we discuss the findings from studies on the genetic component of human longevity and the main challenges accompanying these studies. We subsequently focus on results from genetic studies in model organisms and comparative genomic approaches to highlight the most important conserved longevity-associated pathways. By combining the results from studies using these different approaches, we conclude that only five main pathways have been consistently linked to longevity, namely (1) insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling, (2) DNA-damage response and repair, (3) immune function, (4) cholesterol metabolism and (5) telomere maintenance. As our current approaches to study the relevance of these pathways in humans are limited, we suggest that future studies on the genetics of human longevity should focus on the identification and functional characterization of rare genetic variants in genes involved in these pathways.",

The sustained overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines is a key pathway behind many of these risks. However, contrasting findings suggest that some forms of caregiving may have beneficial effects, such as maintaining caregivers' health and providing a sense of meaning and purpose which, in turn, may contribute to lower rates of functional decline and mortality. The current review synthesizes these disparate literatures, identifies methodological sources of discrepancy, and integrates caregiver research with work on aging biomarkers to propose a research agenda that traces the mechanistic pathways of caregivers' health trajectories with a focus on the unique stressors facing spousal caregivers as compared to other informal caregivers. Combined with a focus on psychosocial moderators and mechanisms, studies using state-of-the-art molecular aging biomarkers such as telomere length, p16INK4a, and epigenetic age could help to reconcile mixed literature on caregiving's sequelae by determining whether and under what conditions caregiving-related experiences contribute to faster aging, in part through inflammatory biology. The biomarkers predict morbidity and mortality, and each contributes non-redundant information about age-related molecular changes -together painting a more complete picture of biological aging. Indeed, assessing changes in these biopsychosocial mechanisms over time would help to clarify the dynamic relationships between caregiving experiences, psychological states, immune function, and aging.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Within cardiovascular aging, arterial aging holds significant importance, as it involves structural and functional alterations in arteries that contribute substantially to the overall decline in cardiovascular health during the aging process. As arteries age, their ability to respond to stress and injury diminishes, while their luminal diameter increases. Moreover, they experience intimal and medial thickening, endothelial dysfunction, loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, cellular senescence, extracellular matrix remodeling, and deposition of collagen and calcium. This aging process also leads to overall arterial stiffening and cellular remodeling. The process of genomic instability plays a vital role in accelerating vascular aging. Progeria syndromes, rare genetic disorders causing premature aging, exemplify the impact of genomic instability. Throughout life, our DNA faces constant challenges from environmental radiation, chemicals, and endogenous metabolic products, leading to DNA damage and genome instability as we age. The accumulation of unrepaired damages over time manifests as an aging phenotype. To study vascular aging, various models are available, ranging from in vivo mouse studies to cell culture options, and there are also microfluidic in vitro model systems known as vessels-on-a-chip. Together, these models offer valuable insights into the aging process of blood vessels.",

In addition, foreign language learning is increasingly endorsed as being a potential intervention to boost cognitive reserve and overall well-being in older adults. Empirical studies on young learners learning lexical tones are aplenty in comparison with older learners. Challenges in this domain for older learners might be different due to aging and other learner-internal factors. This review consolidates behavioural and neuroscientific research related to lexical tone, speech perception, factors characterising learner groups, and other variables that would influence lexical tone perception and learning in older adults. Factors commonly identified to influence tone learning in younger adult populations, such as musical experience, language background, and motivation in learning a new language, are discussed in relation to older learner groups and recommendations to boost lexical tone learning in older age are provided based on existing studies.",

    "abstract": "Aging leads to progressive deterioration of the structure and function of arteries, which eventually contributes to the development of vascular aging-related diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification in eukaryotic RNAs. This reversible m6A RNA modification is dynamically regulated by writers, erasers, and readers, playing a critical role in various physiological and pathological conditions by affecting almost all stages of the RNA life cycle. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of m6A in vascular aging and related diseases, shedding light on its potential clinical significance. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the current understanding of m6A in vascular aging and its clinical implications. We discuss the molecular insights into m6A and its association with clinical realities, emphasizing its significance in unraveling the mechanisms underlying vascular aging. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of m6A and its regulators as clinical indicators for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction and investigate the therapeutic potential of m6A-associated anti-aging approaches. We also examine the challenges and future directions in this field and highlight the necessity of integrating m6A knowledge into patient-centered care. Finally, we emphasize the need for multidisciplinary collaboration to advance the field of m6A research and its clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Despite knowledge gaps in understanding the full spectrum of the hyperinflammatory phase caused by SARS-CoV-2, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 is still the leading cause of death worldwide. Susceptible people to severe COVID-19 are those with underlying medical conditions or those with dysregulated and senescence-associated immune responses. As the immune system undergoes aging in the elderly, such drastic changes predispose them to various diseases and affect their responsiveness to infections, as seen in COVID-19. At-risk groups experience poor prognosis in terms of disease recovery. Changes in the quantity and quality of immune cell function have been described in numerous literature sites. Impaired immune cell function along with age-related metabolic changes can lead to features such as hyperinflammatory response, immunosenescence, and inflammaging in COVID-19. Inflammaging is related to the increased activity of the most inflammatory factors and is the main cause of age-related diseases and tissue failure in the elderly. Since hyperinflammation is a common feature of most severe cases of COVID-19, this pathway, which is not fully understood, leads to immunosenescence and inflammaging in some individuals, especially in the elderly and those with comorbidities. In this review, we shed some light on the age-related abnormalities of innate and adaptive immune cells and how hyperinflammatory immune responses contribute to the inflammaging process, leading to clinical deterioration. Further, we provide insights into immunomodulation-based therapeutic approaches, which are potentially important considerations in vaccine design for elderly populations.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenges facing science/biology today is uncovering the molecular bases that support and determine animal and human longevity. Nature, in offering a diversity of animal species that differ in longevity by more than 5 orders of magnitude, is the best 'experimental laboratory' to achieve this aim. Mammals, in particular, can differ by more than 200-fold in longevity. For this reason, most of the available evidence on this topic derives from comparative physiology studies. But why can human beings, for instance, reach 120 years whereas rats only last at best 4 years? How does nature change the longevity of species? Longevity is a species-specific feature resulting from an evolutionary process. Long-lived animal species, including humans, show adaptations at all levels of biological organization, from metabolites to genome, supported by signaling and regulatory networks. The structural and functional features that define a long-lived species may suggest that longevity is a programmed biological property.",

Moreover, the biological process of aging is the most significant risk factor for most chronic illnesses; therefore, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these aging-related challenges is crucial for extending the healthy lifespan of older individuals. Preventing brain aging remains a priority public health goal, and integrative and comprehensive aging analyses have revealed that immunosenescence is a potential cause of age-related brain damage and disease (e.g., stroke). Importantly, the neuroinflammatory and immune systems present two-way contact and thus can affect each other. Emerging evidence supports the numerous effects of immunosenescence- and inflammation-mediated immunity in neurologically injured brains. In this study, we briefly outline how aging alters the pathophysiology and transcriptional amplitude in patients who experienced stroke and then discuss how the immune system and its cellular components and molecular mechanisms are affected by age after stroke.

    "abstract": "Human lifespan has increased from a median of 46.5âyears in 1950 to 71.7âyears in 2022. As people age, one of the inevitable consequences is a decline in kidney function and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which can have direct or indirect effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of many drugs. Numerous equations have been developed to generate estimated GFR (eGFR) using the two principal biomarkers: serum creatinine and serum cystatin C. However, the trajectory of changes with aging is dissimilar in these equations. In addition, there is recognition that chronological age (lifespan) often does not reflect biological age (healthspan) as an essential parameter in kidney function equations. In the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in quantifying biological age and new commercially available assays have entered the marketplace. In this narrative review, we illustrate how dominant equations of eGFR model the fractional change in this parameter very differently across chronological age. In addition, we review various biological age indicators (aging clocks) and challenges to their application in clinical practice. Importantly, by comparing vancomycin's mean clearance as a drug with limited metabolism and unchanged elimination between two age milestones in some recent population pharmacokinetic models, we show how efforts to quantify kidney function in older adults optimally remain under-explored, particularly those at the upper end of their lifespan. We also propose considering new models that integrate biological age as a new pathway to improve precision drug dosing in older adults.",

Although hair graying is characterized by a loss of pigment in the hair shaft, the underlying mechanism of age-associated hair graying is not fully understood. Hair graying and loss can have a significant impact on an individual's self-esteem and self-confidence, potentially leading to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Omics technologies, which have applications beyond clinical medicine, have led to the discovery of candidate hair biomarkers and may provide insight into the complex biology of hair aging and identify targets for effective therapies. This review provides an up-to-date overview of recent omics discoveries, including age-associated alterations of proteins and metabolites in the hair shaft and follicle, and highlights the significance of hair aging and graying biomarker discoveries. The decline in hair follicle stem cell activity with aging decreased the regeneration capacity of hair follicles. Cellular senescence, oxidative damage and altered extracellular matrix of hair follicle constituents characterized hair follicle and hair shaft aging and graying.

Resulting oxidative stress can cause further cellular damage, including DNA breaks and protein misfolding. This poses a challenge for longevous organisms, including humans. In this review, we hypothesise that in the course of human evolution selective autophagy receptors (SARs) acquired the ability to sense and respond to localised oxidative stress. We posit that in the vicinity of protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria oxidation of key cysteine residues in SARs induces their oligomerisation which initiates autophagy. The degradation of damaged cellular components thus could reduce ROS production and restore redox homeostasis. This evolutionarily acquired function of SARs may represent one of the biological adaptations that contributed to longer lifespan. Inversely, loss of this mechanism can lead to age-related diseases associated with impaired autophagy and oxidative stress.",

Yet how life stress causes such a vast range of diseases is still largely unclear. In recent years, the impact of stress on health and aging has been increasingly associated with the dysregulation of the so-called hallmarks of aging. These are basic biological mechanisms that influence intrinsic cellular functions and whose alteration can lead to accelerated aging. Here, we review correlational and experimental literature (primarily focusing on evidence from humans and murine models) on the contribution of life stress - particularly stress derived from adverse social environments - to trigger hallmarks of aging, including cellular senescence, sterile inflammation, telomere shortening, production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and epigenetic changes. We also evaluate the validity of stress-induced senescence and accelerated aging as an etiopathological proposition.

    "abstract": "Craniofacial defects and dental tissue loss have significant negative impacts on the structure and function of jaws and face, often resulting in psychological issues in patients, emphasizing the urgent need for effective craniofacial tissue reconstruction. Unfortunately, natural regeneration of these tissues is limited. Dental-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising resource for tissue engineering-based therapeutic approaches. However, the clinical outcomes of MSC-based transplantation have not met expectations due to various complex reasons, and cellular senescence is recognized as one of the potential mechanisms contributing to the suboptimal results. The quality of MSC decreases during large-scale in vitro expansion, and it is also influenced by the age and the health status of donors. To address these challenges, extensive efforts have been made to developing strategies to combat senescence in tissue engineering, leveraging on current knowledge of underlying mechanisms. This review aims to elucidate the impact of cell senescence in craniofacial and dental regeneration and provides an overview of state-of-the-art antisenescence strategies. We first discuss the potential factors that trigger cell senescence in craniofacial tissue engineering. Then we describe senescence biomarkers, monitoring methods for senescent MSCs, and their underlying molecular mechanisms. The primary focus of this review is on current strategies to inhibit and alleviate cell senescence in tissue engineering. We summarize the strategies concerning the prevention of cell senescence, senolysis, modulation of the senescent associated secretory phenotype, and reversal of senescent MSCs, offering promising opportunities to overcome the challenges associated with cell senescence in craniofacial tissue engineering.",

Therefore, a new isolation, characterization, and expansion is necessary every time, which increases the variability and is time-consuming. Immortalization is a strategy that can overcome these challenges.

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by systemic chronic inflammation, which is accompanied by cellular senescence, immunosenescence, organ dysfunction, and age-related diseases. Given the multidimensional complexity of aging, there is an urgent need for a systematic organization of inflammaging through dimensionality reduction. Factors secreted by senescent cells, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), promote chronic inflammation and can induce senescence in normal cells. At the same time, chronic inflammation accelerates the senescence of immune cells, resulting in weakened immune function and an inability to clear senescent cells and inflammatory factors, which creates a vicious cycle of inflammation and senescence. Persistently elevated inflammation levels in organs such as the bone marrow, liver, and lungs cannot be eliminated in time, leading to organ damage and aging-related diseases. Therefore, inflammation has been recognized as an endogenous factor in aging, and the elimination of inflammation could be a potential strategy for anti-aging. Here we discuss inflammaging at the molecular, cellular, organ, and disease levels, and review current aging models, the implications of cutting-edge single cell technologies, as well as anti-aging strategies. Since preventing and alleviating aging-related diseases and improving the overall quality of life are the ultimate goals of aging research, our review highlights the critical features and potential mechanisms of inflammation and aging, along with the latest developments and future directions in aging research, providing a theoretical foundation for novel and practical anti-aging strategies.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in the biology of aging is to understand how specific age-onset pathologies relate to the overall health of the organism. The integrity of the intestinal epithelium is essential for the wellbeing of the organism throughout life. In recent years, intestinal barrier dysfunction has emerged as an evolutionarily conserved feature of aged organisms, as reported in worms, flies, fish, rodents and primates. Moreover, age-onset intestinal barrier dysfunction has been linked to microbial alterations, elevated immune responses, metabolic alterations, systemic health decline and mortality. Here, we provide an overview of these findings. We discuss early work in the Drosophila model that sets the stage for examining the relationship between intestinal barrier integrity and systemic aging, then delve into research in other organisms. An emerging concept, supported by studies in both Drosophila and mice, is that directly targeting intestinal barrier integrity is sufficient to promote longevity. A better understanding of the causes and consequences of age-onset intestinal barrier dysfunction has significant relevance to the development of interventions to promote healthy aging.",

A conundrum is that repeated episodes of activation and proliferation drive the differentiation of T cells toward replicative senescence, due to telomere erosion. This review discusses mechanisms that regulate the end-stage differentiation (senescence) of T cells. Although these cells, within both CD4 and CD8 compartments, lose proliferative activity after antigen-specific challenge, they acquire innate-like immune function. While this may confer broad immune protection during aging, these senescent T cells may also cause immunopathology, especially in the context of excessive inflammation in tissue microenvironments.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that restoring mitochondrial function and biogenesis exerts beneficial effects in extending lifespan and promoting healthy aging.

First, we describe the role of senescence in placentation, itself an invasive process which has been linked to higher rates of invasive cancers. Second, we describe how senescent cells can contribute to metastatic dissemination and colonization. Third, we discuss several metabolic adaptations by which senescent cells could promote cancer survival along the metastatic journey.

    "abstract": "Increasing stochasticity is a key feature in the aging process. At the molecular level, in addition to genome instability, a well-recognized hallmark of aging, cell-to-cell variation in gene expression was first identified in mouse hearts. With the technological breakthrough in single-cell RNA sequencing, most studies performed in recent years have demonstrated a positive correlation between cell-to-cell variation and age in human pancreatic cells, as well as mouse lymphocytes, lung cells, and muscle stem cells during senescence in vitro. This phenomenon is known as the \"transcriptional noise\" of aging. In addition to the increasing evidence in experimental observations, progress also has been made to better define transcriptional noise. Traditionally, transcriptional noise is measured using simple statistical measurements, such as the coefficient of variation, Fano factor, and correlation coefficient. Recently, multiple novel methods have been proposed, e.g., global coordination level analysis, to define transcriptional noise based on network analysis of gene-to-gene coordination. However, remaining challenges include a limited number of wet-lab observations, technical noise in single-cell RNA sequencing, and the lack of a standard and/or optimal data analytical measurement of transcriptional noise. Here, we review the recent technological progress, current knowledge, and challenges to better understand transcriptional noise in aging.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the molecular deficiencies underlying human aging has been a formidable challenge as it is clear that a complex myriad of factors including genetic mutations, environmental influences, and lifestyle choices influence the deterioration responsible for human pathologies. In addition, the common denominators of human aging, exemplified by the newly updated hallmarks of aging (LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2023), suggest multiple avenues and layers of crosstalk between pathways important for genome and cellular homeostasis, both of which are major determinants of both good health and lifespan. In this regard, we postulate that hereditary disorders characterized by chromosomal instability offer a unique window of insight into aging and age-related disease processes. Recently, we discovered a new RECQ helicase disorder, designated RECON syndrome attributed to bi-allelic mutations in the RECQL1 gene (Abu-Libdeh et al., 2022). Cells deficient in RECQL1 exhibit genomic instability and a compromised response to replication stress, providing further evidence for the significance of genome homeostasis to suppress disease phenotypes. Here we provide a perspective on the pathology of RECON syndrome to inform the reader as to how molecular defects in the RECQL1 gene contribute to underlying deficiencies in nucleic acid metabolism often seen in certain aging or age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Annual killifish of the genus Nothobranchius are seeing a rapid increase in scientific interest over the years. A variety of aspects surrounding the egg-laying Cyprinodontiformes is being extensively studied, including their aging. Inhabiting drying water bodies of Africa rarely allows survival through more than one rainy season for the Nothobranchius populations. Therefore, there is no lifespan-related bias in natural selection, which has ultimately led to the decreased efficiency of DNA repair system. Aging of the Nothobranchius species is studied both under normal conditions and under the influence of potential geroprotectors, as well as genetic modifications. Most biogerontological studies are conducted using the species Nothobranchius furzeri (GRZ isolate), which has a lifespan of 3 to 7 months. However, the list of model species of Nothobranchius is considerably wider, and the range of advanced research areas with their participation extends far beyond gerontology. This review summarizes the most interesting and promising topics developing in the studies of the fish of Nothobranchius genus. Both classical studies related to lifespan control and rather new ones are discussed, including mechanisms of diapause, challenges of systematics and phylogeny, evolution of sex determination mechanisms, changes in chromosome count, occurrence of multiple repeated DNA sequences in the genome, cognitive and behavioral features and social stratification, as well as methodological difficulties in working with Nothobranchius.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a tissue integral to general health. Due to its high abundance and oxidative capacity, its metabolism is intimately linked to whole-body physiology. In the elderly population, mobility correlates positively with life expectancy and survival. Furthermore, regular physical activity is one of the most effective health-promoting interventions that delay the onset of aging-associated chronic diseases. Data from preclinical studies show that aging of various tissues is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which plays a central role in energy homeostasis. Thus, a hypothesis has emerged that normalization of its content would ameliorate the age-related decline in tissue function and therefore improve health of the elderly. This idea, along with the documented safety and high tolerability of NAD precursor supplementation, makes NAD metabolism a prospective target for anti-aging interventions. Interestingly, muscle NAD biosynthesis pathways are stimulated by exercise training, which suggests that training-induced adaptations rely on tissue NAD levels. However, while the relationship between muscle fitness and regular physical activity is well-characterized, the proposed synergy between muscle NAD replenishment and exercise training has not been established. Here, we review the published data on the role of NAD metabolism in exercise in the context of young and aged skeletal muscle and discuss the current challenges relevant to the field.",

Autophagy is traditionally studied in canonical and research-wise convenient model organisms such as yeast and mice. However, unconventional animal models endowed with extended longevity and exemption from age-related diseases offer a privileged perspective to inquire into the role of autophagy in the evolution of longevity.

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization estimates that the world's population over 60Â years of age will nearly double in the next 30Â years. This change imposes increasing demands on health and social services with increased disease burden in older people, hereafter defined as people aged 60Â years or more. An older population will have a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease partly due to higher levels of blood fibrinogen, increased levels of some coagulation factors, and increased platelet activity. These factors lead to a hypercoagulable state which can alter haemostasis, causing an imbalance in appropriate coagulation, which plays a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. These changes in haemostasis are not only affected by age but also by gender and the effects of hormones, or lack thereof in menopause for older females, ethnicity, other comorbidities, medication interactions, and overall health as we age. Another confounding factor is how we measure fibrinogen and coagulation through laboratory and point-of-care testing and how our decision-making on disease and treatment (including anticoagulation) is managed. It is known throughout life that in normal healthy individuals the levels of fibrinogen and coagulation factors change, however, reference intervals to guide diagnosis and management are based on only two life stages, paediatric, and adult ranges. There are no specific diagnostic guidelines based on reference intervals for an older population. How ageing relates to alterations in haemostasis and the impact of the disease will be discussed in this chapter. Along with the effect of anticoagulation, laboratory testing of fibrinogen and coagulation, future directions, and implications will be presented.",

Historically, it has been considered as an endogenous evolutionary homeostatic mechanism to eliminate damaged cells, including damaged cells which are at risk of malignant transformation, thereby protecting against cancer. However, accumulation of senescent cells can cause long-term detrimental effects, mainly through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, and paradoxically contribute to age-related diseases including cancer. Besides its role as tumor suppressor, cellular senescence is increasingly being recognized as an in vivo response in cancer patients to various anticancer therapies. Its role in cancer is ambiguous and even controversial, and senescence has recently been promoted as an emerging hallmark of cancer because of its hallmark-promoting capabilities. In addition, the prognostic implications of cellular senescence have been underappreciated due to the challenging detection and sparse in and ex vivo evidence of cellular senescence in cancer patients, which is only now catching up. In this review, we highlight the approaches and current challenges of in and ex vivo detection of cellular senescence in cancer patients, and we discuss the prognostic implications of cellular senescence based on in and ex vivo evidence in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "One of the most exciting challenges of the research on aging is to explain how the environmental factors interact with the genetic background to modulate the chances to reach the extreme limit of human life in healthy conditions. The complex epigenetic mechanisms can explain both the interaction between DNA and environmental factors, and the long-distance persistence of lifestyle effects, due to the so called \"epigenetic memory\". One of the most extensively investigated theories on aging focuses on the inflammatory responses, suggesting that the age-related progression of low-grade and therefore for long time subclinical, chronic, systemic, inflammatory process, named \"inflammaging\", could be the most relevant risk factor for the development and progression of the most common age-related diseases and ultimately of death. The results of many studies on long-lived people, especially on centenarians, suggested that healthy old people can cope with inflammaging upregulating the antiinflammaging responses. Overall, a genetic make-up coding for a strong antiinflammaging response and an age-related ability to remodel key metabolic pathways to cope with a plethora of antigens and stressors seem to be the best ways for reach the extreme limit of human lifespan in health status. In this scenario, we wondered if the antifragility concept, recently developed in the framework of business and risk analysis, could add some information to disentangle the heterogeneous nature of the aging process in human. The antifragility is the property of the complex systems to increase their performances because of high stress. Based on this theory we were wondering if some subjects could be able to modulate faster than others their epigenome to cope with a plethora of stressors during life, probably modulating the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. In this framework, antifragility could share some common mechanisms with anti-inflammaging, modulating the ability to restrain the inflammatory responses, so that antifragility and antiinflammaging could be viewed as different pieces of the same puzzle, both impinging upon the chances to travel along the healthy aging trajectory.",

Although originally described in fibroblasts and cell types of solid organs, cellular senescence affects most tissues with advancing age, including the lymphoid tissue, causing chronic inflammation and dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune functions. Besides its normal occurrence, persistent microbial challenge or pathogenic microorganisms might also accelerate the activation of cellular aging, inducing the premature senescence of immune cells. Therapeutic strategies counteracting the detrimental effects of cellular senescence are being developed. Their application to target immune cells might have the potential to improve immune dysfunctions during aging and reduce the age-dependent susceptibility to infections. In this review, we discuss how immune senescence influences the host's ability to resolve more common infections in the elderly and detail the different markers proposed to identify such senescent cells; the mechanisms by which infectious agents increase the extent of immune senescence are also reviewed. Finally, available senescence therapeutics are discussed in the context of their effects on immunity and against infections.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest state that can be triggered by a wide range of intrinsic or extrinsic stresses. Increased burden of senescent cells in various tissues is thought to contribute to aging and age-related diseases. Thus, the detection and interventions of senescent cells are critical for longevity and treatment of disease. However, the highly heterogeneous feature of senescence makes it challenging for precise detection and selective clearance of senescent cells in different age-related diseases. To address this issue, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing senescence-targeting molecular theranostic strategies, based on the potential biomarkers of cellular senescence. Herein, we review recent advances in the field of anti-senescence research and highlight the specific visualization and elimination of senescent cells. Additionally, the challenges in this emerging field are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Seed vigor and longevity are important agronomic attributes, as they are essentially associated with crop yield and thus the global economy. Seed longevity is a measure of seed viability and the most essential property in gene bank management since it affects regeneration of seed recycling. Reduced seed life or storability is a serious issue in seed storage since germplasm conservation and agricultural enhancement initiatives rely on it. The irreversible and ongoing process of seed deterioration comprises a complex gene regulatory network and altered metabolism that results in membrane damage, DNA integrity loss, mitochondrial dysregulation, protein damage, and disrupted antioxidative machinery. Carbohydrates and/or sugars, primarily raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), have emerged as feasible components for boosting or increasing seed vigor and longevity in recent years. RFOs are known to perform diverse functions in plants, including abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, besides being involved in regulating seed germination, desiccation tolerance, vigor, and longevity. We emphasized and analyzed the potential impact of RFOs on seed vigor and longevity in this review. Here, we comprehensively reviewed the molecular mechanisms involved in seed longevity, RFO metabolism, and how RFO content is critical and linked with seed vigor and longevity. Further molecular basis, biotechnological approaches, and CRISPR/Cas applications have been discussed briefly for the improvement of seed attributes and ultimately crop production. Likewise, we suggest advancements, challenges, and future possibilities in this area.",

    "abstract": "Senescence is a cellular stress response that involves prolonged cell survival, a quasi-irreversible proliferative arrest and a modification of the transcriptome that sometimes includes inflammatory gene expression. Senescent cells are resistant to apoptosis, and if not eliminated by the immune system they may accumulate and lead to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. Senolytics are drugs that selectively induce cell death in senescent cells, but not in proliferative or quiescent cells, and they have proved a viable therapeutic approach in multiple mouse models of pathologies in which senescence is implicated. As the catalogue of senolytic compounds is expanding, novel survival strategies of senescent cells are uncovered, and variations in sensitivity to senolysis between different types of senescent cells emerge. We propose herein a mechanistic classification of senolytic drugs, based on the level at which they target senescent cells: directly disrupting BH3 protein networks that are reorganized upon senescence induction; downregulating survival-associated pathways essential to senescent cells; or modulating homeostatic processes whose regulation is challenged in senescence. With this approach, we highlight the important diversity of senescent cells in terms of physiology and pathways of apoptosis suppression, and we describe possible avenues for the development of more selective senolytics.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a stress response elicited by different molecular insults. Senescence results in cell cycle exit and is characterised by multiple phenotypic changes such as the production of a bioactive secretome. Senescent cells accumulate during ageing and are present in cancerous and fibrotic lesions. Drugs that selectively kill senescent cells (senolytics) have shown great promise for the treatment of age-related diseases. Senescence plays paradoxical roles in cancer. Induction of senescence limits cancer progression and contributes to therapy success, but lingering senescent cells fuel progression, recurrence, and metastasis. In this review, we describe the intricate relation between senescence and cancer. Moreover, we enumerate how current anticancer therapies induce senescence in tumour cells and how senolytic agents could be deployed to complement anticancer therapies. \"One-two punch\" therapies aim to first induce senescence in the tumour followed by senolytic treatment to target newly exposed vulnerabilities in senescent tumour cells. \"One-two punch\" represents an emerging and promising new strategy in cancer treatment. Future challenges of \"one-two punch\" approaches include how to best monitor senescence in cancer patients to effectively survey their efficacy.",

The search for mechanisms that underlie inflammaging focused initially on the hallmarks of aging, but it is rapidly expanding in multiple directions. Here, we discuss the threads connecting cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction to impaired mitophagy and DNA damage, which may act as a hub for inflammaging. We explore the emerging multi-omics efforts that aspire to define the complexity of inflammaging - and identify molecular signatures and novel targets for interventions aimed at counteracting excessive inflammation and its deleterious consequences while preserving the physiological immune response. Finally, we review the emerging evidence that inflammation is involved in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that senescent cells accumulate with aging. They are characterized by replicative arrest and the release of a myriad of factors commonly called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Despite the replicative cell cycle arrest, these cells are metabolically active and functional. The release of SASP factors is mostly thought to cause tissue dysfunction and to induce senescence in surrounding cells. As major markers for aging and senescence, p16INK4, p14ARF/p19ARF, and p21 are established. Importantly, senescence is also implicated in development, cancer, and tissue homeostasis. While many markers of senescence have been identified, none are able to unambiguously identify all senescent cells. However, increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16INK4A and p21 are often used to identify cells with senescence-associated phenotypes. We review here the knowledge of senescence, p16INK4A, p14ARF/p19ARF, and p21 in embryonic and postnatal development and potential functions in pathophysiology and homeostasis. The establishment of senolytic therapies with the ultimate goal to improve healthy aging requires care and detailed knowledge about the involvement of senescence and senescence-associated proteins in developmental processes and homeostatic mechanism. The review contributes to these topics, summarizes open questions, and provides some directions for future research.",

Using various models, such as yeasts, appropriate tissue culture cells, Drosophila, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the mouse, has tremendously increased our knowledge around the relationship between diet, nutrient-response signaling pathways and lifespan regulation. In recent years, combinatorial drug treatments combined with mutagenesis, high-throughput screens, as well as multi-omics approaches, have provided unprecedented insights in cellular metabolism, development, differentiation, and aging. Scientists are, therefore, moving towards characterizing the fine architecture and cross-talks of growth and stress pathways towards identifying possible interventions that could lead to healthy aging and the amelioration of age-related diseases in humans. In this short review, we briefly examine recently uncovered knowledge around nutrient-response pathways, such as the Insulin Growth Factor (IGF) and the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin signaling pathways, as well as specific GWAS and some EWAS studies on lifespan and age-related disease that have enhanced our current understanding within the aging and biogerontology fields.

The field of potential therapies continues to expand as new mechanistic targets of cell senescence and the SASP are identified. Ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies of drugs targeting cellular senescence yield significant promise, but have yet to demonstrate long-term efficacy. Therapeutic targeting of senescence is challenged by the diverse phenotypes of senescent cells, which can vary depending on age, species, tissue source, and type of physiologic stressor.

Age-related impairment of immune function (immunosenescence) is one important cause of age-related morbidity and mortality, which may extend beyond its role in infectious disease. One aspect of immunosenescence that has received less attention is age-related natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction, characterized by reduced cytokine secretion and decreased target cell cytotoxicity, accompanied by and despite an increase in NK cell numbers with age. Moreover, recent studies have revealed that NK cells are the central actors in the immunosurveillance of senescent cells, whose age-related accumulation is itself a probable contributor to the chronic sterile low-grade inflammation developed with aging (\"inflammaging\"). NK cell dysfunction is therefore implicated in the increasing burden of infection, malignancy, inflammatory disorders, and senescent cells with age. This review will focus on recent advances and open questions in understanding the interplay between systemic inflammation, senescence burden, and NK cell dysfunction in the context of aging. Understanding the factors driving and enforcing NK cell aging may potentially lead to therapies countering age-related diseases and underlying drivers of the biological aging process itself.",

A major subset of tunable nutrients are the minerals, which despite being integral to every aspect of metabolism are often deficient in the typical Western diet. Mitochondria are particularly rich in minerals, where they function as essential cofactors for mitochondrial physiology and overall cellular health. Yet substantial knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the form and function of these minerals needed for metabolic harmony. Some of the minerals have known activities in the mitochondria but with incomplete regulatory detail, whereas other minerals have no established mitochondrial function at all. A comprehensive metallome of the mitochondria is needed to fully understand the patterns and relationships of minerals within metabolic processes and cellular development. This brief overview serves to highlight the current progress towards understanding mineral homeostasis in the mitochondria and to encourage more research activity in key areas. Future work may likely reveal that adjusting the amounts of specific nutritional minerals has longevity benefits for human health.",

    "abstract": "Human-driven environmental changes are affecting wildlife across the globe. These challenges do not influence species or populations to the same extent and therefore a comprehensive evaluation of organismal health is needed to determine their ultimate impact. Evidence suggests that telomeres (the terminal chromosomal regions) are sensitive to environmental conditions and have been posited as a surrogate for animal health and fitness. Evaluation of their use in an applied ecological context is still scarce. Here, using information from molecular and occupational biomedical studies, we aim to provide ecologists and evolutionary biologists with an accessible synthesis of the links between human disturbances and telomere length. In addition, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies measuring telomere length in wild/wild-derived animals facing anthropogenic disturbances. Despite the relatively small number of studies to date, our meta-analysis revealed a significant small negative association between disturbances and telomere length (-0.092 [-0.153, -0.031]; nÂ =Â 28; kÂ =Â 159). Yet, our systematic review suggests that the use of telomeres as a biomarker to understand the anthropogenic impact on wildlife is limited. We propose some research avenues that will help to broadly evaluate their suitability: (i) further causal studies on the link between human disturbances and telomeres; (ii) investigating the organismal implications, in terms of fitness and performance, of a given telomere length in anthropogenically disturbed scenarios; and (iii) better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of telomere dynamics. Future studies in these facets will help to ultimately determine their role as markers of health and fitness in wildlife facing anthropogenic disturbances.",

    "abstract": "The concept of geroscience is that since ageing is the greatest risk factor for many diseases and conditions, targeting the ageing process itself will have the greatest impact on human health. Of the hallmarks of ageing, cellular senescence has emerged as a druggable therapeutic target for extending healthspan in model organisms. Cellular senescence is a cell state of irreversible proliferative arrest driven by different types of stress, including oncogene-induced stress. Many senescent cells (SnCs) develop a senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) comprising pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, bioactive lipids, inhibitory molecules, extracellular vesicles, metabolites, lipids and other factors, able to promote chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. SnCs up-regulate senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs) that prevent them from dying despite the accumulation of damage to DNA and other organelles. These SCAPs and other pathways altered in SnCs represent therapeutic targets for the development of senotherapeutic drugs that induce selective cell death of SnCs, specifically termed senolytics or suppress markers of senescence, in particular the SASP, termed senomorphics. Here, we review the current state of the development of senolytics and senomorphics for the treatment of age-related diseases and disorders and extension of healthy longevity. In addition, the challenges of documenting senolytic and senomorphic activity in pre-clinical models and the current state of the clinical application of the different senotherapeutics will be discussed.",

Age-related sarcopenia is characterized by decreased muscular strength, decreased muscle quantity, quality, and decreased functional performance. Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a condition that combines sarcopenia and obesity and has a substantial influence on the older adults' health. Because of the complicated pathophysiology, there are disagreements and challenges in identifying and diagnosing SO. Recently, it has become clear that dysbiosis may play a role in the onset and progression of sarcopenia and SO. Skeletal muscle secretes myokines during contraction, which play an important role in controlling muscle growth, function, and metabolic balance. Myokine dysfunction can cause and aggravate obesity, sarcopenia, and SO. The only ways to prevent and slow the progression of sarcopenia, particularly sarcopenic obesity, are physical activity and correct nutritional support. While exercise cannot completely prevent sarcopenia and age-related loss in muscular function, it can certainly delay development and slow down the rate of sarcopenia. The purpose of this review was to discuss potential pathways to muscle deterioration in obese individuals. We also want to present the current understanding of the role of various factors, including microbiota and myokines, in the process of sarcopenia and SO.",

This process is strongly associated with higher metabolic and oxidative stress, low-grade inflammation, accumulation of DNA mutations and increased levels of related damage. Detrimental changes that accumulate in body cells and tissues with time raise the vulnerability to environmental challenges and enhance the risk of major chronic diseases and mortality. There are several theses concerning the mechanisms of ageing: genetic, free radical telomerase, mitochondrial decline, metabolic damage, cellular senescence, neuroendocrine theory, Hay-flick limit and membrane theories, cellular death as well as the accumulation of toxic and non-toxic garbage. Moreover, ageing is associated with structural changes within the myocardium, cardiac conduction system, the endocardium as well as the vasculature. With time, the cardiac structures lose elasticity, and fibrotic changes occur in the heart valves. Ageing is also associated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis. The results of studies suggest that some natural compounds may slow down this process and protect against age-related diseases. Animal studies imply that some of them may prolong the lifespan; however, this trend is not so obvious in humans.",

Preferential release of drugs and macromolecular formulations within senescent cells has been predominantly achieved by exploiting one of the most widely used biomarkers of senescence, the increase in lysosomal senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) activity, a common feature of most reported senescent cell types. Galacto-conjugation is a versatile therapeutic and detection strategy to facilitate preferential targeting of senescent cells by using a variety of existing formulations, including modular systems, nanocarriers, activatable prodrugs, probes, and small molecules. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of these specific senescence targeting tools and how the strategy of galacto-conjugation might be utilised to design more specific and sophisticated next-generation senotherapeutics, as well as theranostic agents.

    "abstract": "The purpose of the \"Micronuclei and Disease\" special issue (SI) is to: (i) Determine the level of evidence for association of micronuclei (MN), a biomarker of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations, with risk of specific diseases in humans; (ii) Define plausible mechanisms that explain association of MN with each disease; (iii) Identify knowledge gaps and research needed to translate MN assays into clinical practice. The \"MN and Disease\" SI includes 14 papers. The first is a review of mechanisms of MN formation and their consequences in humans. 11 papers are systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of the association of MN with reproduction, child health, inflammation, auto-immune disease, glycation, metabolic diseases, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, eleven common cancers, ageing and frailty. The penultimate paper focuses on effect of interventions on MN frequency in the elderly. A road map for translation of MN data into clinical practice is the topic of the final paper. The majority of reviewed studies were case-control studies in which the ratio of mean MN frequency in disease cases relative to controls, i.e. the mean ratio (MR), was calculated. The mean of these MR values, estimated by meta-analyses, for lymphocyte and buccal cell MN in non-cancer diseases were 2.3 and 3.6 respectively, and for cancers they were 1.7 and 2.6 respectively. The highest MR values were observed in studies of cancer cases in which MN were measured in the same tissue as the tumour (MR = 4.9-10.8). This special issue is an important milestone in the evidence supporting MN as a reliable genomic biomarker of developmental and degenerative disease risk. These advances, together with results from prospective cohort studies, are helping to identify diseases in which MN assays can be practically employed in the clinical setting to better identify high risk patients and to prioritise them for preventive therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism generates molecular damage affecting all levels of biological organization. Accumulation of this damage over time is thought to play a central role in the aging process, but damage manifests in diverse molecular forms complicating its assessment. Insufficient attention has been paid to date to the role of molecular damage in aging-related phenotypes, particularly in humans, in part because of the difficulty in measuring its various forms. Recently, omics approaches have been developed that begin to address this challenge, because they are able to assess a sizeable proportion of age-related damage at the level of small molecules, proteins, RNA, DNA, organelles and cells. This review describes the concept of molecular damage in aging and discusses its diverse aspects from theoretical models to experimental approaches. Measurement of multiple types of damage enables studies of the role of damage in human aging outcomes and lays a foundation for testing interventions to reduce the burden of molecular damage, opening new approaches to slowing aging and reducing its consequences.",

    "abstract": "SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family of longevity regulators, possesses potent activities preventing vascular aging. The expression and function of SIRT1 in endothelial cells are downregulated with age, in turn causing early vascular aging and predisposing various vascular abnormalities. Overexpression of SIRT1 in the vascular endothelium prevents aging-associated endothelial dysfunction and senescence, thus the development of hypertension and atherosclerosis. Numerous efforts have been directed to increase SIRT1 signaling as a potential strategy for different aging-associated diseases. However, the complex mechanisms underlying the regulation of SIRT1 have posed a significant challenge toward the design of specific and effective therapeutics. This review aimed to provide a summary on the regulation and function of SIRT1 in the vascular endothelium and to discuss the different approaches targeting this molecule for the prevention and treatment of age-related cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",

    "title": "Cognitive and metacognitive, motivational, and resource considerations for learning new skills across the lifespan.",
    "abstract": "Across the lifespan, learners have to tackle the challenges of learning new skills. These skills can range from abilities needed for survival, such as learning languages, learning to walk during infancy, and learning new software for a job in adulthood, to abilities related to leisure and hobbies. As the learner progresses through novice to expert stages, there are cognitive and metacognitive, motivational, and resource considerations for learning new skills. In terms of cognitive considerations, fluid and crystallized abilities as well as executive functions interact to help the learner process and retain information related to the skills. In terms of metacognitive considerations, knowing what to learn and how to learn are important for novel skill learning. In terms of motivational considerations, changes in individuals' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation throughout the lifespan impact their pursuit of novel skill learning, and declines in motivation can be buffered through the cultivation of grit, growth mindset, self-efficacy, and other personal factors. In terms of resource considerations, there are many tools that learners can use to acquire new skills, but allocation and availability of these resources differ based on life stage and socioeconomic status. Taken together, these considerations may provide learners with the best chance at acquiring new skills across the lifespan. Further research investigating these three factors, particularly among older adult learners, and their interactive effects could help increase our understanding of their impacts on skill learning and inform future cognitive interventions that can be tailored to learners' unique needs.

    "abstract": "Identifying ways to deal with the challenges presented by aging is an urgent task, as we are facing an aging society. External factors such as diet, exercise and drug therapy have proven to be major elements in controlling healthy aging and prolonging life expectancy. More recently, the intestinal microbiota has also become a key factor in the anti-aging process. As the intestinal microbiota changes with aging, an imbalance in intestinal microorganisms can lead to many age-related degenerative diseases and unhealthy aging. This paper reviews recent research progress on the relationship between intestinal microorganisms and anti-aging effects, focusing on the changes and beneficial effects of intestinal microorganisms under dietary intervention, exercise and drug intervention. In addition, bacteriotherapy has been used to prevent frailty and unhealthy aging. Most of these anti-aging approaches improve the aging process and age-related diseases by regulating the homeostasis of intestinal flora and promoting a healthy intestinal environment. Intervention practices based on intestinal microorganisms show great potential in the field of anti-aging medicine.",

    "title": "Skeletal muscle aging, cellular senescence, and senotherapeutics: Current knowledge and future directions.",
    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest induced by several forms of metabolic stress. Senescent cells accumulate with advancing age and have a distinctive phenotype, characterized by profound chromatin alterations and a robust senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that exerts negative effects on tissue health, both locally and systemically. In preclinical models, pharmacological agents that eliminate senescent cells (senotherapeutics) restore health and youthful properties in multiple tissues. To date, however, very little is understood about the vulnerability of terminally-differentiated skeletal muscle fibers and the resident mononuclear cells that populate the interstitial microenvironment of skeletal muscle to senescence, and their contribution to the onset and progression of skeletal muscle loss and dysfunction with aging. Scientific advances in these areas have the potential to highlight new therapeutic approaches to optimize late-life muscle health. To this end, this review highlights the current evidence and the key questions that need to be addressed to advance the field's understanding of cellular senescence as a mediator of skeletal muscle aging and the potential for emerging senescent cell-targeting therapies to counter age-related deficits in muscle mass, strength, and function.

As the world population ages, the prevalence of age-associated diseases, and their associated health care costs, has increased sharply. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to cellular dysfunction may provide important targets for interventions to prevent or treat these diseases. Recent Advances: Although the mitochondrial theory of aging had been proposed more than 40 years ago, recent new data have given stronger support for a central role for mitochondrial dysfunction in several pathways that are deregulated during normal aging and age-associated disease. Critical Issues: Several of the experimental evidence linking mitochondrial alterations to age-associated loss of function are correlative and mechanistic insights are still elusive. Here, we review how mitochondrial dysfunction may be involved in many of the known hallmarks of aging, and how these pathways interact in an intricate net of molecular relationships. Future Directions: As it has become clear that mitochondrial dysfunction plays causative roles in normal aging and age-associated diseases, it is necessary to better define the molecular interactions and the temporal and causal relationship between these changes and the relevant phenotypes seen during the aging process.

    "abstract": "The research of the last two decades has defined a crucial role of cellular senescence in both the physiology and pathology of skin, and senescent cells have been detected in conditions including development, regeneration, aging, and disease. The pathophysiology of cellular senescence in skin is complex as the phenotype of senescence pertains to several different cell types including fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes, among others. Paradoxically, the transient presence of senescent cells is believed to be beneficial in the context of development and wound healing, while the chronic presence of senescent cells is detrimental in the context of aging, diseases, and chronic wounds, which afflict predominantly the elderly. Identifying strategies to prevent senescence induction or reduce senescent burden in the skin could broadly benefit the aging population. Senolytics, drugs known to specifically eliminate senescent cells while preserving non-senescent cells, are being intensively studied for use in the clinical setting. Here, we review recent research on skin senescence, on the methods for the detection of senescent cells and describe promises and challenges related to the application of senolytic drugs.

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence, classically defined as stable cell cycle arrest, is implicated in biological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing and ageing. Senescent cells have a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), involving a range of pro-inflammatory factors with important paracrine and autocrine effects on cell and tissue biology. Clinical evidence and experimental studies link cellular senescence, senescent cell accumulation, and the production and release of SASP components with age-related cardiac pathologies such as heart failure, myocardial ischaemia and infarction, and cancer chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity. However, the precise role of senescent cells in these conditions is unclear and, in some instances, both detrimental and beneficial effects have been reported. The involvement of cellular senescenceÂ in other important entities, such as cardiac arrhythmias and remodelling, is poorly understood. In this Review, we summarize the basic biology of cellular senescence and discuss what is known about the role of cellular senescence and the SASP in heart disease. We then consider the various approaches that are being developed to prevent the accumulation of senescent cells and their consequences. Many of these strategies are applicable in vivo and some are being investigated for non-cardiac indications in clinical trials. We end by considering important knowledge gaps, directions for future research and the potential implications for improving the management of patients with heart disease.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive function decline is strictly related to age, resulting in the loss of the ability to perform daily behaviors and is a fundamental clinical neurodegeneration symptom. It has been proven that an adequate diet, comprehensive nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle may significantly inhibit neurodegenerative processes, improving cognitive functions. Therefore, intensive research has been conducted on cognitive-enhancing treatment for many years, especially with substances of natural origin. There are several intervention programs aimed at improving cognitive functions in elderly adults. Cognitive functions depend on body weight, food consumed daily, the quality of the intestinal microflora, and the supplements used. The effectiveness in the prevention of dementia is particularly high before the onset of the first symptoms. The impact of diet and nutrition on age-associated cognitive decline is becoming a growing field as a vital factor that may be easily modified, and the effects may be observed on an ongoing basis. The paper presents a review of the latest preclinical and clinical studies on the influence of natural antioxidants on cognitive functions, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, despite the promising research results in animal models, the clinical application of natural compounds will only be possible after solving a few challenges.",

Senescent cells accumulate with age and actively secrete soluble factors, collectively termed the 'senescence-associated secretory phenotype' (SASP), which has both beneficial and detrimental effects. Although the contribution of senescent cells to age-related pathologies has been well-established outside the brain, emerging evidence indicates that brain cells also undergo cellular senescence and contribute to neuronal loss in the context of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Contribution of senescent cells in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders has led to the possibility of eliminating senescence cells via pharmacological compounds called senolytics. Recently several senolytics have been demonstrated to elicit improved cognitive performance and healthspan in mouse models of neurodegeneration. However, their translation for use in the clinic still holds several potential challenges. This review summarizes available senolytics, their purported mode of action, and possible off-target effects.

Such questions await thorough investigation that may help us understand how aberrant proteinaceous bodies lead to neurodegeneration and imperfect aging. However, these studies face multiple technological challenges in utilizing available tools for detailed characterizations of the protein aggregates or amyloids and developing new techniques to understand the biology and pathology of proteopathies. The lack of detection and analysis methods has decelerated the pace of the research in amyloid biology. Here, we address the significance of aggregation and inclusion formation, followed by exploring the evolutionary contribution of these structures. We also provide a detailed overview of current state-of-the-art techniques and advances in studying amyloids in the diseased brain.

Developing new strategies to delay or attenuate cognitive decline is vital. For this purpose, it is imperative to understand the cellular and molecular events at the basis of brain aging. While several organs are directly accessible to molecular analysis through biopsies, the brain constitutes a notable exception. Most of the molecular studies are performed on postmortem tissues, where cell death and tissue damage have already occurred. Hence, the study of the molecular aspects of cognitive decline largely relies on animal models and in particular on small mammals such as mice. What have we learned from these models? Do these animals recapitulate the changes observed in humans? What should we expect from future mouse studies? In this review we answer these questions by summarizing the state of the research that has addressed cognitive decline in mice from several perspectives, including genetic manipulation and omics strategies. We conclude that, while extremely valuable, mouse models have limitations that can be addressed by the optimal design of future studies and by ensuring that results are cross-validated in the human context.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The vasculature responds to the respiratory needs of tissue by modulating luminal diameter through smooth muscle constriction or relaxation. Coronary perfusion, diastolic function, and coronary flow reserve are drastically reduced with aging. This loss of blood flow contributes to and exacerbates pathological processes such as angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery and microvascular disease. Recent Advances: Increased attention has recently been given to defining mechanisms behind aging-mediated loss of vascular function and development of therapeutic strategies to restore youthful vascular responsiveness. The ultimate goal aims at providing new avenues for symptom management, reversal of tissue damage, and preventing or delaying of aging-induced vascular damage and dysfunction in the first place. Critical Issues: Our major objective is to describe how aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction via dysregulated reactive oxygen species production, the clinical impact of this phenomenon, and to discuss emerging therapeutic strategies. Pathological changes in regulation of mitochondrial oxidative and nitrosative balance (Section 1) and mitochondrial dynamics of fission/fusion (Section 2) have widespread effects on the mechanisms underlying the ability of the vasculature to relax, leading to hyperconstriction with aging. We will focus on flow-mediated dilation, endothelial hyperpolarizing factors (Sections 3 and 4), and adrenergic receptors (Section 5), as outlined in Figure 1. The clinical implications of these changes on major adverse cardiac events and mortality are described (Section 6).

Genome sequencing techniques assure comprehensive mapping of human genetics; however, understanding of gene functional interactions, specifically of time/age-dependent modifications, remain challenging. The age of the genome is defined by the sum of individual (inherited) and acquired genomic traits, based on internal and external factors that impact ontogenesis from the moment of egg fertilization and embryonic development. The biological part of genomic age opens a new perspective for intervention. The discovery of single cell-based mechanisms for genetic change indicates the possibility of influencing aging and associated disease burden, as well as metabolism. Cell populations with transformed genetic background were shown to serve as the origin of common diseases during extended life expectancy (superaging). Consequently, age-related cell transformation leads to cancer and cell degeneration (senescence). This article aims to describe current advances in the genomic mechanisms of senescence and its role in the spatiotemporal spread of epithelial clones and cell evolution.",

Ageing is associated with an increased prevalence of atherosclerosis, coronary artery stenosis and subsequent myocardial infarction, thoracic aortic aneurysm, valvular heart disease and heart failure. An accumulation of senescence and increased inflammation, caused by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, have been implicated in the aetiology and progression of these age-associated diseases. Recently it has been demonstrated that compounds targeting components of anti-apoptotic pathways expressed by senescent cells can preferentially induce senescence cells to apoptosis and have been termed senolytics. In this review, we discuss the evidence demonstrating that senescence contributes to cardiovascular disease, with a particular focus on studies that indicate the promise of senotherapy. Based on these data we suggest novel indications for senolytics as a treatment of cardiovascular diseases which have yet to be studied in the context of senotherapy. Finally, while the potential benefits are encouraging, several complications may result from senolytic treatment. We, therefore, consider these challenges in the context of the cardiovascular system.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and fatal lung disease that significantly impacts the aging population globally. To date, anti-fibrotic, immunosuppressive, and other adjunct therapy demonstrate limited efficacies. Advancing our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of lung fibrosis will provide a future path for the cure. Cellular senescence has gained substantial interest in recent decades due to the increased incidence of fibroproliferative lung diseases in the older age group. Furthermore, the pathologic state of cellular senescence that includes maladaptive tissue repair, decreased regeneration, and chronic inflammation resembles key features of progressive lung fibrosis. This review describes regulatory pathways of cellular senescence and discusses the current knowledge on the senescence of critical cellular players of lung fibrosis, including epithelial cells (alveolar type 2 cells, basal cells, etc.), fibroblasts, and immune cells, their phenotypic changes, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these cells contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. A few challenges in the field include establishing appropriate in vivo experimental models and identifying senescence-targeted signaling molecules and specific therapies to target senescent cells, known collectively as \"senolytic\" or \"senotherapeutic\" agents.",

    "abstract": "Age-related bone disorders such as osteoporosis or osteoarthritis are a major public health problem due to the functional disability for millions of people worldwide. Furthermore, fractures are associated with a higher degree of morbidity and mortality in the long term, which generates greater financial and health costs. As the world population becomes older, the incidence of this type of disease increases and this effect seems notably greater in those countries that present a more westernized lifestyle. Thus, increased efforts are directed toward reducing risks that need to focus not only on the prevention of bone diseases, but also on the treatment of persons already afflicted. Evidence is accumulating that dietary lipids play an important role in bone health which results relevant to develop effective interventions for prevent bone diseases or alterations, especially in the elderly segment of the population. This review focuses on evidence about the effects of dietary lipids on bone health and describes possible mechanisms to explain how lipids act on bone metabolism during aging. Little work, however, has been accomplished in humans, so this is a challenge for future research.",

    "abstract": "Proper skeletal muscle function is controlled by intracellular Ca2+ concentration and by efficient production of energy (ATP), which, in turn, depend on: (a) the release and re-uptake of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic-reticulum (SR) during excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, which controls the contraction and relaxation of sarcomeres; (b) the uptake of Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix, which stimulates aerobic ATP production; and finally (c) the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular space via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), a mechanism that is important to limit/delay muscle fatigue. Abnormalities in Ca2+ handling underlie many physio-pathological conditions, including dysfunction in ageing. The specific focus of this review is to discuss the importance of the proper architecture of organelles and membrane systems involved in the mechanisms introduced above for the correct skeletal muscle function. We reviewed the existing literature about EC coupling, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, SOCE and about the structural membranes and organelles deputed to those functions and finally, we summarized the data collected in different, but complementary, projects studying changes caused by denervation and ageing to the structure and positioning of those organelles: a. denervation of muscle fibers-an event that contributes, to some degree, to muscle loss in ageing (known as sarcopenia)-causes misplacement and damage: (i) of membrane structures involved in EC coupling (calcium release units, CRUs) and (ii) of the mitochondrial network; b. sedentary ageing causes partial disarray/damage of CRUs and of calcium entry units (CEUs, structures involved in SOCE) and loss/misplacement of mitochondria; c. functional electrical stimulation (FES) and regular exercise promote the rescue/maintenance of the proper architecture of CRUs, CEUs, and of mitochondria in both denervation and ageing. All these structural changes were accompanied by related functional changes, i.e., loss/decay in function caused by denervation and ageing, and improved function following FES or exercise. These data suggest that the integrity and proper disposition of intracellular organelles deputed to Ca2+ handling and aerobic generation of ATP is challenged by inactivity (or reduced activity); modifications in the architecture of these intracellular membrane systems may contribute to muscle dysfunction in ageing and sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "Lipid-based signalling modulates several cellular processes and intercellular communication during wound healing and tissue regeneration. Bioactive lipids include but are not limited to the diverse group of eicosanoids, phospholipids, and extracellular vesicles and mediate the attraction of immune cells, initiation of inflammatory responses, and their resolution. In aged individuals, wound healing and tissue regeneration are greatly impaired, resulting in a delayed healing process and non-healing wounds. Senescent cells accumulate with age in vivo, preferably at sites implicated in age-associated pathologies and their elimination was shown to alleviate many age-associated diseases and disorders. In contrast to these findings, the transient presence of senescent cells in the process of wound healing exerts beneficial effects and limits fibrosis. Hence, clearance of senescent cells during wound healing was repeatedly shown to delay wound closure in vivo. Recent findings established a dysregulated synthesis of eicosanoids, phospholipids and extracellular vesicles as part of the senescent phenotype. This intriguing connection between cellular senescence, lipid-based signalling, and the process of wound healing and tissue regeneration prompts us to compile the current knowledge in this review and propose future directions for investigation.",

For example, the accentuated heterogeneity of these patients, the potential presence of multiple comorbidities, the increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, the increased dependence on care and the effect of frailty all add to the complexity of managing diabetes mellitus in this age group. In this Review, we offer an update on the key pathophysiological mechanisms associated with T2DM in older people.

A feature of AT is its capability to expand in response to physiological challenges, such as pregnancy and aging, and during chronic states of positive energy balance occurring throughout life. AT grows through adipogenesis and/or an increase in the size of existing adipocytes. One process that is required for healthy AT growth is the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is a necessary step to restore mechanical homeostasis and maintain tissue integrity and functionality. While the relationship between mechanobiology and adipogenesis is now well recognized, less is known about the role of adipocyte mechanosignaling pathways in AT growth. In this review article, we first summarize evidence linking ECM remodelling to AT expansion and how its perturbation is associated to a metabolically unhealthy phenotype. Subsequently, we highlight findings suggesting that molecules involved in the dynamic, bidirectional process (mechanoreciprocity) enabling adipocytes to sense changes in the mechanical properties of the ECM are interconnected to pathways regulating lipid metabolism. Finally, we discuss processes through which aging may influence the ability of adipocytes to appropriately respond to alterations in ECM composition.",

    "abstract": "Developmental programming predisposes offspring to metabolic, behavioural and reproductive dysfunction in adult life. Evidence is accumulating that ageing phenotype and longevity are in part developmentally programmed in each individual. Unfortunately, there are few studies addressing the effects of developmental programming by maternal nutrition on the rate of ageing of the male reproductive system. This review will discuss effects of foetal exposure to maternal environmental challenges on male offspring fertility and normal ageing of the male reproductive system. We focus on several key factors involved in reproductive ageing such as decreased hormone production, DNA fragmentation, oxidative stress, telomere shortening, epigenetics, maternal lifestyle and nutrition. There is compelling evidence that ageing of the male reproductive system is developmentally programmed. Both maternal over- or undernutrition accelerate ageing of male offspring reproductive function through similar mechanisms such as decreased serum testosterone levels, increase in oxidative stress biomarkers in both the testes and sperm and changes in sperm quality. Importantly, even in adult life, exercise in male offspring of obese mothers improves adverse effects of programming on reproductive function. Maternal consumption of a low-protein diet causes transgenerational effects in progeny via the paternal line. The seminal fluid has effects on the intrauterine environment. Programming by male factors may involve more than just the sperm. Improving knowledge on developmental programming ageing interactions will improve not only male health and life span but also the health of future generations by reducing programming via the paternal line.",

Programming alters life-course phenotype in multiple organs, predisposing to diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease that shorten lifespan. This review describes studies in rodents, the most commonly studied species, addressing interactions of programming challenges with ageing. We first consider ageing and programming of insulin function that has been clearly shown to decrease with age. It is important to evaluate ageing in pancreatic islets isolated from other systems. Studies discussed show premature pancreatic islet ageing resulting from both maternal under- and overnutrition. New ways to determine programming of adipose tissue and effects on fat storage are explored. Oxidative stress is a major factor that regulates ageing in tissues. Oxidative stress is discussed in relation to reproductive and cardiovascular ageing. Premature ageing is associated with both low and high glucocorticoid function. Both over and undernutrition have offspring sex-specific programming effects on life-course glucocorticoid concentrations. Evidence is provided that maternal age at conception affects offspring endocrine and metabolism ageing. Finally, the importance of matching foetal nutrition and energy availability with composition and energy content in the post-weaning diet is demonstrated. This mismatch can lead to a greatly shortened lifespan. General principles are discussed throughout. For example, sexual dimorphism of age-related outcomes can be marked. Accelerated ageing occurs early in life. Improving knowledge on programming ageing interactions will improve health span as well as lifespan. Finally, there are considerable similarities in outcomes programmed by maternal undernutrition and overnutrition.",

In this Review, we propose ten molecular hallmarks to represent common denominators of T cell aging. These hallmarks are grouped into four primary hallmarks (thymic involution, mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and loss of proteostasis) and four secondary hallmarks (reduction of the TCR repertoire, naive-memory imbalance, T cell senescence, and lack of effector plasticity), and together they explain the manifestation of the two integrative hallmarks (immunodeficiency and inflammaging). A major challenge now is weighing the relative impact of these hallmarks on T cell aging and understanding their interconnections, with the final goal of defining molecular targets for interventions in the aging process.",

Darkness-mediated premature leaf senescence is a well-studied stressor. It initiates the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs), which have been implicated in chlorophyll breakdown and degradation. The molecular and biochemical regulatory mechanisms of premature leaf senescence show significant levels of redundant biomass in complex pathways. Thus, clarifying the regulatory mechanisms of low-light/dark-induced senescence may be conducive to developing strategies for rice crop improvement.

Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to understand why and how a cell acquires and maintains a senescent phenotype. Direct evidence has pointed to the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum whose control appears strikingly affected during senescence. The endoplasmic reticulum is one of the sensing organelles that transduce signals between different pathways in order to adapt a functional proteome upon intrinsic or extrinsic challenges. One of these signaling pathways is the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which has been shown to be activated during senescence. Its exact contribution to senescence onset, maintenance, and escape, however, is still poorly understood. In this article, we review the mechanisms through which the UPR contributes to the appearance and maintenance of characteristic senescent features. We also discuss whether the perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis or accumulation of misfolded proteins could be possible causes of senescence, and-as a consequence-to what extent the UPR components could be considered as therapeutic targets allowing for the elimination of senescent cells or altering their secretome to prevent neoplastic transformation.",

In the context of the underlying pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic and genetic alterations, and other mechanisms have been studied and as a consequence, several rejuvenation strategies targeting these mechanisms like pharmaceutical interventions, genetic modification, and cellular reprogramming have been proposed. On the other hand, since stem cells have great potential for disease modeling, they have been useful for representing aging and its associated disorders. Accordingly, the main mechanisms of senescence in stem cells and promising ways of rejuvenation, along with some examples of stem cell models for aging are introduced and discussed. This review aims to prepare a comprehensive summary of the findings by focusing on the most recent ones to shine a light on this area of research.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate with age and cause various age-related diseases. Clearance of SCs by transgenic or pharmaceutical strategies has been demonstrated to delay aging, treat age-related diseases and extend healthspan. SCs are resistant to various stressors because they are protected from apoptosis by SC anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs). Targeting the proteins in the SCAPs with small molecules can selectively kill SCs, the effector proteins are called senolytic targets and the small molecules are called senolytics. Until now, a series of senolytic targets, such as BCL-XL, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), Na+/K+ ATPase, bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4), and oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) have been identified. However, current senolytics targeting these proteins still have some limitations in killing SCs in terms of safety, specificity and broad-spectrum activity. To overcome the challenges, some new strategies, such as proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and Î²-galactosidase-modified prodrugs, were developed to clear SCs and shown to have promising therapeutic potential. Here we review the significance of SCs in aging and age-related diseases, summarize the known senolytic targets and highlight the emerging new strategies for clearing SCs.",

    "title": "Interplay between bioenergetics and oxidative stress at normal brain aging. Aging as a result of increasing disbalance in the system oxidative stress-energy provision.",
    "abstract": "At normal aging, the brain exhibits signs of compromised bioenergetic and increased levels of products of interaction between reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and brain constituents. Under normal conditions, steady-state levels of ATP and ROS/RNS fluctuate in certain ranges providing basis for stable homeostasis. However, from time to time these parameters leave a \"comfort zone,\" and at adulthood, organisms are able to cope with these challenges efficiently, whereas at aging, efficiency of the systems maintaining homeostasis declines. That is very true for the brain due to high ATP demands which are mainly covered by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Such active oxidative metabolism gives rise to intensive ROS generation as side products. The situation is worsened by high brain level of polyunsaturated fatty acids which are substrates for ROS/RNS attack and production of lipid peroxides. In this review, organization of energetic metabolism in the brain with a focus on its interplay with ROS at aging is discussed. The working hypothesis on aging as a disbalance between oxidative stress and energy provision as a reason for brain aging is proposed. From this point of view, normal age-related physiological decline in the brain functions results from increased disbalance between decrease in capability of the brain to control constantly increased incapability to maintain ROS levels and produce ATP due to amplification of vicious cycles intensification of oxidative stress <----> impairment of energy provision.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide. Over the last four decades, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have improved substantially, giving patients with localized disease a better chance of cure, and those with more advanced cancer, longer periods of disease control and survival. However, understanding and managing heterogeneity in the clinical response exhibited by patients remains a challenge. For some treatments, biomarkers are available to inform therapeutic options, assess pathological response and predict clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, some measurements are not employed universally and lack sensitivity and specificity, which might be influenced by tissue-specific alterations associated with aging and lifestyle. The first part of this article summarizes available and emerging biomarkers for clinical use, such as measurements that can be made in tumor biopsies or blood samples, including so-called liquid biopsies. The second part of this article outlines underappreciated factors that could influence the interpretation of these clinical measurements and affect treatment outcomes. For example, it has been shown that both adiposity and physical activity can modify the characteristics of tumors and surrounding tissues. In addition, evidence shows that inflammaging and immunosenescence interact with treatment and clinical outcomes and could be considered prognostic and predictive factors independently. In summary, changes to blood and tissues that reflect aging and patient characteristics, including lifestyle, are not commonly considered clinically or in research, either for practical reasons or because the supporting evidence base is developing. Thus, an aim of this article is to encourage an integrative phenomic approach in oncology research and clinical management.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system has the enormous challenge to protect the host through the generation and differentiation of pathogen-specific short-lived effector T cells while in parallel developing long-lived memory cells to control future encounters with the same pathogen. A complex regulatory network is needed to preserve a population of naÃ¯ve cells over lifetime that exhibit sufficient diversity of antigen receptors to respond to new antigens, while also sustaining immune memory. In parallel, cells need to maintain their proliferative potential and the plasticity to differentiate into different functional lineages. Initial signs of waning immune competence emerge after 50âyears of age, with increasing clinical relevance in the 7th-10th decade of life. Morbidity and mortality from infections increase, as drastically exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Many vaccines, such as for the influenza virus, are poorly effective to generate protective immunity in older individuals. Age-associated changes occur at the level of the T-cell population as well as the functionality of its cellular constituents. The system highly relies on the self-renewal of naÃ¯ve and memory T cells, which is robust but eventually fails. Genetic and epigenetic modifications contribute to functional differences in responsiveness and differentiation potential. To some extent, these changes arise from defective maintenance; to some, they represent successful, but not universally beneficial adaptations to the aging host. Interventions that can compensate for the age-related defects and improve immune responses in older adults are increasingly within reach.",

    "abstract": "The immune system is a tightly regulated network which allows the development of defense mechanisms against foreign antigens and tolerance toward self-antigens. Regulatory T cells (Treg) contribute to immune homeostasis by maintaining unresponsiveness to self-antigens and suppressing exaggerated immune responses. Dysregulation of any of these processes can lead to serious consequences. Classically, Treg cell functions have been described in CD4+ T cells, but other immune cells also harbour the capacity to modulate immune responses. Regulatory functions have been described for different CD8+ T cell subsets, as well as other T cells such as Î³Î´T cells or NKT cells. In this review we describe the diverse populations of Treg cells and their role in different scenarios. Special attention is paid to the aging process, which is characterized by an altered composition of immune cells. Treg cells can contribute to the development of various age-related diseases but they are poorly characterized in aged individuals. The huge diversity of cells that display immune modulatory functions and the lack of universal markers to identify Treg make the expanding field of Treg research complex and challenging. There are still many open questions that need to be answered to solve the enigma of regulatory T cells.",

    "title": "Hallmarks of aging and immunosenescence: Connecting the dots.",
    "abstract": "Aging is a natural physiological process that features various and variable challenges, associated with loss of homeostasis within the organism, often leading to negative consequences for health. Cellular senescence occurs when cells exhaust the capacity to renew themselves and their tissue environment as the cell cycle comes to a halt. This process is influenced by genetics, metabolism and extrinsic factors. Immunosenescence, the aging of the immune system, is a result of the aging process, but can also in turn act as a secondary inducer of senescence within other tissues. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding hallmarks of aging in relation to immunosenescence, with a focus on aging-related imbalances in the medullary environment, as well as the components of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Aging within the immune system alters its functionality, and has consequences for the person's ability to fight infections, as well as for susceptibility to chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype is described, as well as the involvement of this phenomenon in the paracrine induction of senescence in otherwise healthy cells. Inflammaging is discussed in detail, along with the comorbidities associated with this process. A knowledge of these processes is required in order to consider possible targets for the application of senotherapeutic agents - interventions with the potential to modulate the senescence process, thus prolonging the healthy lifespan of the immune system and minimizing the secondary effects of immunosenescence.",

    "abstract": "Plant stem cells have several extraordinary features: they are generated de novo during development and regeneration, maintain their pluripotency, and produce another stem cell niche in an orderly manner. This enables plants to survive for an extended period and to continuously make new organs, representing a clear difference in their developmental program from animals. To uncover regulatory principles governing plant stem cell characteristics, our research project 'Principles of pluripotent stem cells underlying plant vitality' was launched in 2017, supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas from the Japanese government. Through a collaboration involving 28 research groups, we aim to identify key factors that trigger epigenetic reprogramming and global changes in gene networks, and thereby contribute to stem cell generation. Pluripotent stem cells in the shoot apical meristem are controlled by cytokinin and auxin, which also play a crucial role in terminating stem cell activity in the floral meristem; therefore, we are focusing on biosynthesis, metabolism, transport, perception, and signaling of these hormones. Besides, we are uncovering the mechanisms of asymmetric cell division and of stem cell death and replenishment under DNA stress, which will illuminate plant-specific features in preserving stemness. Our technology support groups expand single-cell omics to describe stem cell behavior in a spatiotemporal context, and provide correlative light and electron microscopic technology to enable live imaging of cell and subcellular dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this perspective, we discuss future directions of our ongoing projects and related research fields.",

Dysregulation of Treg cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation, while aging is characterized by an accumulation of inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood, a phenomenon known as 'inflammaging'. The relationship between Treg cells and age-related diseases remains to be further studied. Increasing evidence revealed that Treg cells' dysfunction occurs in aged patients, suggesting that immune therapies targeting Treg cells may be a promising approach to treat diseases such as cancers and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, drugs targeting Treg cells show encouraging results and contribute to CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxic killing of tumor and infected cells. In general, a better understanding of Treg cell function may help us to develop new immune therapies against aging. In this review, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies to modify immune responses of relevance for aging to prevent and treat age-related diseases, as well as the challenges posed by the translation of novel immune therapies into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The ageing of the global population brings about unprecedented challenges. Chronic age-related diseases in an increasing number of people represent an enormous burden for health and social care. The immune system deteriorates during ageing and contributes to many of these age-associated diseases due to its pivotal role in pathogen clearance, tissue homeostasis and maintenance. Moreover, in order to develop treatments for COVID-19, we urgently need to acquire more knowledge about the aged immune system, as older adults are disproportionally and more severely affected. Changes with age lead to impaired responses to infections, malignancies and vaccination, and are accompanied by chronic, low-degree inflammation, which together is termed immunosenescence. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie immunosenescence, termed immune cell senescence, are mostly unknown. Cellular senescence, characterised by an irreversible cell cycle arrest, is thought to be the cause of tissue and organismal ageing. Thus, better understanding of cellular senescence in immune populations at single-cell level may provide us with insight into how immune cell senescence develops over the life time of an individual. In this review, we will briefly introduce the phenotypic characterisation of aged innate and adaptive immune cells, which also contributes to overall immunosenescence, including subsets and function. Next, we will focus on the different hallmarks of cellular senescence and cellular ageing, and the detection techniques most suitable for immune cells. Applying these techniques will deepen our understanding of immune cell senescence and to discover potential druggable pathways, which can be modulated to reverse immune ageing.",

Here we present a hierarchical framework highlighting how these biomarkers are related to each other and the underlying biological processes. We review those measures most studied in the context of brain aging: epigenetic clocks, proteomic clocks, and neuroimaging age predictors. Many studies have linked these biomarkers to cognition, mental health, brain structure, and pathology during aging. We also delve into the challenges and complexities in interpreting these biomarkers and suggest areas for further innovation. Ultimately, a robust mechanistic understanding of these biomarkers will be needed to effectively intervene in the aging process to prevent and treat age-related disease.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation that adversely affects physiological function. The liver regulates systemic inflammation; it is a source of cytokine production and also scavenges bacteria from the portal circulation to prevent infection of other organs. The cells with primary roles in these functions, hepatic macrophages, become more numerous in the liver with \"normal\" aging (i.e., in the absence of disease). Here, we demonstrate evidence and potential mechanisms for this phenomenon, which include augmented tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in the liver. Also, we discuss how an age-related impairment in autophagy within macrophages leads to a pro-oxidative state and ensuing production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6). Given that the liver is a rich source of macrophages, we posit that it represents a major source of the elevated systemic IL-6 observed with aging, which is associated with physiological dysfunction. Testing a causal role for liver macrophage production of IL-6 during aging remains a challenge, yet interventions that have targeted macrophages and/or IL-6 have demonstrated promise in treating age-related diseases. These studies have demonstrated an age-related, deleterious reprogramming of macrophage function, which worsens pathology. Therefore, hepatic macrophage accrual is indeed a cause for concern, and therapies that attenuate the aged phenotype of macrophages will likely prove useful in promoting healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, cellular senescence has become the focus of attention in multiple areas of biomedical research. Typically defined as an irreversible cell cycle arrest accompanied by increased cellular growth, metabolic activity and by a characteristic messaging secretome, cellular senescence can impact on multiple physiological and pathological processes such as wound healing, fibrosis, cancer and ageing. These unjustly called 'zombie cells' are indeed a rich source of opportunities for innovative therapeutic development. In this review, we collate the current understanding of the process of cellular senescence and its two-faced nature, i.e. beneficial/detrimental, and reason this duality is linked to contextual aspects. We propose the senescence programme as an endogenous pro-resolving mechanism that may lead to sustained inflammation and damage when dysregulated or when senescent cells are not cleared efficiently. This pro-resolving model reconciles the paradoxical two faces of senescence by emphasising that it is the unsuccessful completion of the programme, and not senescence itself, what leads to pathology. Thus, pro-senescence therapies under the right context, may favour inflammation resolution. We also review the evidence for the multiple therapeutic approaches under development based on senescence, including its induction, prevention, clearance and the use of senolytic and senomorphic drugs. In particular, we highlight the importance of the immune system in the favourable outcome of senescence and the implications of an inefficient immune surveillance in completion of the senescent cycle. Finally, we identify and discuss a number of challenges and existing gaps to encourage and stimulate further research in this exciting and unravelled field, with the hope of promoting and accelerating the clinical success of senescence-based therapies.",

This proteostasis collapse has long been considered a hallmark of aging in nematodes, and has recently been shown to occur also in human cells upon entry to senescence, opening the way to exploring the phenomenon in the broader context of human aging. Cellular senescence is part of the normal human physiology of aging, with senescent cell accumulation as a prominent feature of aged tissues. Being highly resistant to cell death, senescent cells, as they accumulate, become pro-inflammatory and promote disease. Here we discuss the causes of human senescence proteostasis decline, in view of the current literature on nematodes, on the one hand, and senescence, on the other hand. We review two major aspects of the phenomenon: (1) the decline in transcriptional activation of stress-response pathways, and (2) impairments in proteasome function. We further outline potential underlying mechanisms of transcriptional proteostasis decline, focusing on reduced chromatin dynamics and compromised nuclear integrity. Finally, we discuss potential strategies for reinforcing proteostasis as a means to improve organismal health and address the relationship to senolytics.",

    "abstract": "Ageing induces a great risk factor that participates in progressing various degenerative diseases morbidities. The main characteristic of ageing is the failure in maintaining homeostasis in the organs with a cellular senescence. Senescence is characterized by reduced cell growth, evade cellular death, and acquiring a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are advantageous cells in regenerative medicine, exerting pleiotropic functions by producing soluble factors, such as exosomes. MSCs and their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) kinetic are affected by ageing and other aged exosomes. Exosomes biogenesis from aged MSCs is accelerated and their exosomal cargoes, such as miRNAs, vary as compared to those of normal cells. Besides, exosomes from aged MSCs loss their regenerative potential and may negatively influence the function of recipient cells. MSCs-Exo can improve ageing and age-related diseases; however, the detailed mechanisms remain yet elusive. Although exosomes-therapy may serve as a new approach to combat ageing, the translation of preclinical results to clinic needs more extensive investigation on exosomes both on their biology and related techniques. Overall, scrutiny on the effect of ageing on MSCs and vice versa is vital for designing novel therapy using MSCs with focus on the management of older individuals.",

This review discusses the age-related alterations in responsiveness to infection from the standpoint of virus:host relationship and the host physiological whole-organism and specific immune response to the virus. Changes with age in the innate and adaptive immune system homeostasis and function are reviewed briefly. This is followed by a review of specific alterations and defects in the response of older organisms (chiefly mice and humans) to acute (particularly emerging and re-emerging) viral infections, with a very brief summary of the response to latent persistent infections. Finally, we provide a brief summary of the perspectives for possible interventions to enhance antiviral immunity.",

    "title": "The use of geroprotectors to prevent multimorbidity: Opportunities and challenges.",
    "abstract": "Over 60 % of people over the age of 65 will suffer from multiple diseases concomitantly but the common approach is to treat each disease separately. As age-associated diseases have common underlying mechanisms there is potential to tackle many diseases with the same pharmacological intervention. These are known as geroprotectors and could overcome the problems related to polypharmacy seen with the use of the single disease model. With some geroprotectors now reaching the end stage of preclinical studies and early clinical trials, there is a need to review the evidence and assess how they can be translated practically and effectively into routine practice. Despite promising evidence, there are many gaps and challenges in our understanding that must be addressed to make geroprotective medicine effective in the treatment of age-associated multimorbidity. Here we highlight the key barriers to clinical translation and discuss whether geroprotectors such as metformin, rapamycin and senolytics can tackle all age-associated diseases at the same dose, or whether a more nuanced approach is required. The evidence suggests that geroprotectors' mode of action may differ in different tissues or in response to different inducers of accelerating ageing, suggesting that a blunt 'one drug for many diseases' approach may not work. We make the case for the use of artificial intelligence to better understand multimorbidity, allowing identification of clusters and networks of diseases that are significantly associated beyond chance and the underpinning molecular pathway of ageing causal to each cluster. This will allow us to better understand the development of multimorbidity, select a more homogenous group of patients for intervention, match them with the appropriate geroprotector and identify biomarkers specific to the cluster.",

    "title": "A guide to assessing cellular senescence inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo.",
    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a physiological mechanism whereby a proliferating cell undergoes a stable cell cycle arrest upon damage or stress and elicits a secretory phenotype. This highly dynamic and regulated cellular state plays beneficial roles in physiology, such as during embryonic development and wound healing, but it can also result in antagonistic effects in age-related pathologies, degenerative disorders, ageing and cancer. In an effort to better identify this complex state, and given that a universal marker has yet to be identified, a general set of hallmarks describing senescence has been established. However, as the senescent programme becomes more defined, further complexities, including phenotype heterogeneity, have emerged. This significantly complicates the recognition and evaluation of cellular senescence, especially within complex tissues and living organisms. To address these challenges, substantial efforts are currently being made towards the discovery of novel and more specific biomarkers, optimized combinatorial strategies and the development of emerging detection techniques. Here, we compile such advances and present a multifactorial guide to identify and assess cellular senescence in cell cultures, tissues and living organisms. The reliable assessment and identification of senescence is not only crucial for better understanding its underlying biology, but also imperative for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting senescence in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Among aging-induced impairments, those affecting cognitive functions certainly represent one the most major challenge to face to improve elderly quality of life. In last decades, our knowledge on changes in the morphology and function of neuronal networks associated with normal and pathological brain aging has rapidly progressed, initiating the development of different pharmacological and behavioural strategies to alleviate cognitive aging. In particular, experimental evidences have accumulated indicating that the communication between neurons and its plasticity gradually weakens with aging. Because of its pivotal role for brain functional plasticity, the N-Methylâd-Aspartate receptor subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAr) has gathered much of the experimental interest. NMDAr activation is regulated by many mechanisms. Among is the mandatory binding of a co-agonist, such as the amino acid d-serine, in order to activate NMDAr. This mini-review presents the most recent information indicating how d-serine could contribute to mechanisms of physiological cognitive aging and also considers the divergent views relative of the role of the NMDAr co-agonist in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Older Caregivers With HIV: An Unrecognized Gap in the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Although the number of older people living with HIV (PLWH) is growing, prior research has focused on older PLWH as care recipients and psychosocial factors (e.g., stigma, social support) associated with their HIV care. Literature on HIV caregiving mainly focuses on family members providing care to PLWH or children of parents with HIV. There is a gap in the literature in terms of older PLWH's roles as caregivers to their family members. Thanks to combination antiretrovirals that help PLWH live longer and have healthier lives, many older PLWH now find themselves in a position to provide care to family members. To help older PLWH age successfully, it is important to understand their role as caregivers while they juggle responsibilities with their own health care needs. This article elucidates this gap in the literature on older PLWH who are caregivers and provides direction for a research agenda and potential clinical implications.",

    "title": "Deep learning for biological age estimation.",
    "abstract": "Modern machine learning techniques (such as deep learning) offer immense opportunities in the field of human biological aging research. Aging is a complex process, experienced by all living organisms. While traditional machine learning and data mining approaches are still popular in aging research, they typically need feature engineering or feature extraction for robust performance. Explicit feature engineering represents a major challenge, as it requires significant domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning provide a paradigm shift in eliciting meaningful knowledge from complex data without performing explicit feature engineering. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning in biological age estimation. We consider the current data modalities that have been used to study aging and the deep learning architectures that have been applied. We identify four broad classes of measures to quantify the performance of algorithms for biological age estimation and based on these evaluate the current approaches. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on possible future directions in biological aging research using deep learning. This study has significant potentials for improving our understanding of the health status of individuals, for instance, based on their physical activities, blood samples and body shapes. Thus, the results of the study could have implications in different health care settings, from palliative care to public health.",

    "abstract": "Significance: Senescence is a cellular state induced by internal or external stimuli, which result in cell cycle arrest, morphological changes, and dysfunctions in mitochondrial and lysosomal functionality as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Senescent cells accumulate in tissues in physiological and pathological conditions such as development, tissue repair, aging, and cancer. Recent Advances: Growing evidences indicate that senescent cells in vivo are a heterogeneous cell population due to different cell-autonomous activated pathways and distinct microenvironmental contexts. Critical Issues: In this review, we discuss the different contexts where senescence assumes a key role with beneficial or harmful outcomes. The heterogeneous nature of senescence pushes toward resolution of the specific molecular profile and secretome to typify senescent cells in physiological and pathological contexts. Future Directions: Future research will enable exploring the heterogeneity of the senescent population to precisely map the progression of cells through senescent trajectories and study the impact of the therapeutic advantage of senolytic drugs for translational strategies toward supporting the health span.

    "title": "Senescence in Post-Mitotic Cells: A Driver of Aging?",
    "abstract": "Significance: Cell senescence was originally defined by an acute loss of replicative capacity and thus believed to be restricted to proliferation-competent cells. More recently, senescence has been recognized as a cellular stress and damage response encompassing multiple pathways or senescence domains, namely DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype, senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy/mitophagy dysfunction, nutrient and stress signaling, and epigenetic reprogramming. Each of these domains is activated during senescence, and all appear to interact with each other. Cell senescence has been identified as an important driver of mammalian aging. Recent Advances: Activation of all these senescence domains has now also been observed in a wide range of post-mitotic cells, suggesting that senescence as a stress response can occur in nondividing cells temporally uncoupled from cell cycle arrest. Here, we review recent evidence for post-mitotic cell senescence and speculate about its possible relevance for mammalian aging. Critical Issues: Although a majority of senescence domains has been found to be activated in a range of post-mitotic cells during aging, independent confirmation of these results is still lacking for most of them. Future Directions: To define whether post-mitotic senescence plays a significant role as a driver of aging phenotypes in tissues such as brain, muscle, heart, and others. Antioxid.
