Moreover, SAA can remove senescent stromal cells and reverse the SASP expression trend of the senescent stromal cells in a tumor microenvironment after therapy with genotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby reducing the resistance of tumor to the chemotherapeutic drugs, and significantly improving the actual anti-tumor effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, SAA can further significantly prolong the survival of experimental animals in the later stage of life.",

The histone H2A deubiquitinase MYSM1 has a nucleotide sequence shown as SEQ ID NO. 1. It is verified that MYSM1 protein deficiency causes significant aging of mice and induces the aging-related diseases; and the MYSM1 can promote DNA injury repair, prevent cellular senescence and suppress chronic inflammation. Proved by a result of using an adeno-associated virus expressing mouse-derived MYSM1 as a gene therapy, the MYSM1 may remarkably prolong the lifespan of the mice, reduce the process and the number of senescent cells, improve normal functions of tissues and organs, reduce occurrence and development of the aging-related diseases, which proves that the MYSM1 has a good application prospect in delaying aging and treating the aging-related diseases.",

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has been shown to be capable of reducing cellular oxidative stress to alleviate aging-related mitochondrial dysfunction. To solve the problems of poor NMN stability and low bioavailability, natural ovalbumin (OVA) and fucoidin are self-assembled in the absence of any chemical substance by means of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to prepare a steady-state carrying system. Moreover, compared with free NMN, OFNPs with encapsulated NMN show significant controlled-release capacities in simulated digestion processes, and effectively ease cellular senescence and reduce lipofuscin accumulation in nematodes. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that OFNPs can be used as a potential steady-state carrying system to improve the stability and anti-aging activity of NMN.",

According to the method, the senescence of the human mesenchymal stem cells is delayed by overexpressing SLFN11 genes in the human mesenchymal stem cells. The human mesenchymal stem cell senescence model comprises a replicative hMSC senescence model and a DNA damage induced hMSC senescence model; overexpression of the SLFN11 gene is achieved in the mode that lentivirus infects human mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, the invention further provides application of the modified human mesenchymal stem cells in preparation of medicine for treating ulcerative colitis. A replicative hMSC senescence model and a DNA damage induced hMSC senescence model are adopted, and the two senescence cell models overexpress SLFN11 by utilizing a lentivirus infection technology, so that senescence phenotypes of the replicative hMSC senescence model and the camptothecin induced DNA damage induced hMSC senescence model can be remarkably reduced; the cells are inoculated to the subcutaneous part of a nude mouse without chromosome abnormality and tumorigenicity, are transplanted to an ulcerative colitis mouse model without immunological exclusion reaction, and have a better treatment effect than normal hMSC.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase-interacting protein (GIT) having anti-senescence activity, and a use thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention or treatment of senescence or senescence-associated diseases and a composition for inhibition of cellular senescence, each comprising GIT or a GIT activating agent as an active ingredient, to a method for screening a cellular senescence inhibitor, and to a method for inhibition of cellular senescence. In the present invention, it is confirmed that the expression of senescence markers was reduced as a result of overexpressing GIT or GIT-CT in senescent cells due to decreased expression of βPIX, and that the decrease in senescence-induced cell endocytosis was inhibited. Accordingly, GIT of the present invention has an inhibitory activity against cellular senescence, and thus can be used as a novel therapeutic agent for senescence or senescence-associated diseases.

    "abstract": "By the normal cellular processes free radicals are formed and it react with the bodies macromolecules and created different types of disorders like cancer, diabetes etc. Other causes of forming free radicals are like environmental stresses, and UV irradiation. ROS react with cellular components such as and finally damaged the tissue (Naskar et al., 2011). High amount of reactive oxygen species can also lead to inflammation, premature aging disorders, and several disease states, including cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Organisms have developed complex antioxidant systems to protect themselves from oxidative stress; however, excess ROS can overwhelm the systems and cause severe damage. Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the antioxidant defense system. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are various forms of activated oxygen which causes oxidative damage (Li et al., 2011). Mechanisms responsible for the ROS-mediated injuries mainly include lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage and protein oxidation .Antioxidants are compounds that detoxify ROS and prevent their damage through multimechanisms. Synthetic antioxidants have been in use as food additives for a long time, but reports on their involvement in chronic diseases have restricted their use in foods (Aghdam et al.,2011;Valko et al., 2007). Therefore, international attention has been focused on natural antioxidants mainly from plant sources (Siddique et al., 2010). In recent years, there is an increasing interest in finding antioxidant phytochemicals, because they can inhibit the propagation of free-radical reactions and protect the human body from diseases. Free-radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide are an entire class of highly reactive molecules derived from the normal metabolism of oxygen or from exogenous factors and agents. ROS’s were reported to be a causative agent of various diseases such as arthritis, asthma, dementia, mongolism, carcinoma and Parkinson’s disease (Lavanya et al., 2010).From the cellular redox process ROS and RNS are formed as by-products and are well documented for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. The ROS and RNS have beneficial effects at low/moderate concentrations and involve in several normal physiological function against several cellular responses. Most cells can produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide constitutively while others have inducible ROS/RNS release system. For example defense against infectious agents by phagocytosis, killing of cancer cells by macrophages and cytotoxic lymphocytes, detoxification of xenobiotics by Cytochrome P450, generation of ATP in mitochondria (energy production), cell growth, and the induction of mitogenic responses at low concentrations are some key beneficial activities of ROS and RNS(Sen and Chakraborty, 2011). at low concentration, they also play important role on different cellular signalling like activation of several cytokines and growth factor signalling, non-receptor tyrosine kinases activation, protein tyrosine phosphatises activation, release of calcium from intracellular stores, activation of nuclear transcription factors. ROS exert vital actions such as gene transcription, and regulation of soluble guanylate cyclise activity in cells. Though in normal physiological condition the generation of reactive species are tightly regulated by different enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant, but overproduction of ROS results in oxidative stress, which is important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. Through four critical steps, Oxidative stress causes different diseases via membrane lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, DNA damage and disturbance in reducing equivalents of the cell; which leads to cell destruction, altered signaling pathways.",

Also, it has been demonstrated that the in vivo cytotoxic and antitumor models of the so-called Argentatins are present in 20% to 40% of the GIR. Therefore, the present invention presents the exudates that the plant expels when it suffers an attack (EG), which indicates that EG contains a high content of Argentatins and a cytotoxic activity for human cancer cells, making it feasible that EG has the same property of induction of cellular senescence as reported for Argentatines A and B.

    "abstract": "It was discovered that by binding to CTCF which is important for maintaining chromosomal structures, hSATII RNA inhibits the function thereof, changes chromosome interaction, and induces transcription of inflammation-associated genes. It has also been discovered that cell death can be selectively induced in senescent cells and cancer cells by suppressing hSATII RNA expression. From the obtained results, it has been found that cancer treatment which targets senescent stromal cells and cancer cells can be performed with a substance that suppresses hSATII RNA or a substance that increases CTCF expression. In addition, cancer can be detected early by measuring the expression and activity of hSATII RNA and CTCF, and an epigenomic change of the hSATII DNA region. Thus, it is possible to provide a therapeutic drug for a cancer associated with cellular senescence, a method for screening thereof, and a test support method.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is characterised by a progressive loss of physical and functional integrity, which progressively affects the body's health. A peculiar feature of ageing is the increase in the number of senescent cells, which have entered a state of irreversible arrest of cell cycles after exceeding an inherent or environmental stress level. Although cellular senescence is an essential process for several physiological processes, it plays a detrimental role in a large number of age-related pathologies. A first aspect of the invention provides a composition of plant extracts to mitigate the effects of ageing comprising an asiaticoside content of at least 6.0% by weight, preferably from a Centella asiatica extract, a verbascoside content of at least 2.5% by weight, preferably from a Cistanche extract, a hesperidin content of at least 12.5% by weight, preferably from a sweet orange extract and a punicalagin content of at least 3.0% by weight, preferably from a pomegranate extract. A composition such as that described above prevents the negative effects of ageing by reducing the number of cells reaching the senescent state, due to the ability of said formulation to prevent or reduce telomere shortening during cell division. This composition is particularly indicated for preventing the effects of ageing on the skin.",

The catechin fraction exhibited differential effects on growth of bacteria with strong inhibition of pathogenic bacteria as opposed to probiotic bacteria suggesting its prebiotic efficacy. In vitro testing indicated protective effects of catechin and probiotics in a synergistic manner resulting in amelioration of oxidative and inflammatory stress. In vivo analysis in aging animals further indicated that the synbiotic combination could rejuvenate the aging immune system by enhancing cellular immune response with increase in numbers (CD3+ T cells) as well as activation status of cellular immune cells (CD3+ T cells/neutrophils) along with their functional capacity (Th1/Th2 immune response) coupled with a corresponding decrease in humoral immune response (IgA) in intestine suggesting the impact of synbiotics in activating cellular immunity. Further, total antioxidant capacity (in plasma) increased in synbiotic fed animals with increased Nrf2 expression while no unwarranted exacerbation of inflammation (NfkB expression) was observed in liver extracts. Several of the observed effects showed synergism wherein the effect of synbiotics was more pronounced than pure additive effects of individual components. Together, it appears that this novel synbiotic formulation could significantly impact aging physiology and help ameliorate some of the deleterious effects during aging.",

    "abstract": "Acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) often bear a mutation in the NPM1 nucleolar chaperone, but the transforming properties of the NPM1c oncoprotein remain incompletely understood. Here the inventors show that NPM1c binding to PML, a key senescence gene, disrupts PML nuclear bodies (NB) yielding proliferation, mitochondrial alterations and intracellular stress. Actinomycin-D (ActD), an anticancer antibiotic with clinical efficacy in NPM1c-AMLs, targets these dysfunctional mitochondria to induce ROS. The later disrupt disulphide-linked NPM1c/PML complex, restoring PML NBs and initiating senescence. An ActD-responsive patient displayed features of mitochondria-initiated senescence. These studies highlight unexpected mitochondrial involvement both downstream of the NPM1c/PML axis and as a key feature of ActD therapy. More particularly, the inventors pre-treated AML cells with ActD and/or Venetoclax, a Bcl2-targeting agent and showed that the two drugs sharply synergized to abolish clonogenic growth of NPM1c-expressing, but not control or PML-deficient cells. Collectively, these results support that combination of antineoplastic antibiotics and BCL-2 inhibitors would be suitable for the treatment of NPM-1-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML).",

In the present invention, these partially reprogrammed spheroids are embedded in Collagen-I matrices of varying densities, mimicking different 3D tissue constraints. In response to such matrix constraints, these spheroids regained their fibroblastic properties and sprouted to form 3D connective tissue networks. Interestingly, it was found that these differentiated fibroblasts exhibit reduced DNA damage, enhanced cytoskeletal gene expression and acto-myosin contractility. In addition, the rejuvenated fibroblasts show increased matrix protein (fibronectin and laminin) deposition and collagen remodelling compared to the parental fibroblast tissue network. Furthermore, it is shown that the partially reprogrammed cells have comparatively open chromatin compaction states and may be more poised to redifferentiation into contractile fibroblasts in 3D-collagen matrix.

    "abstract": "By the normal cellular processes free radicals are formed and it react with the bodies macromolecules and created different types of disorders like cancer, diabetes etc. High amount of reactive oxygen species can also lead to inflammation, premature aging disorders, and several disease states, including cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Organisms have developed complex antioxidant systems to protect themselves from oxidative stress; however, excess ROS can overwhelm the systems and cause severe damage. Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the antioxidant defense system. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are various forms of activated oxygen which causes oxidative damage (Li et al., 2011). Mechanisms responsible for the ROS-mediated injuries mainly include lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage and protein oxidation .Antioxidants are compounds that detoxify ROS and prevent their damage through multimechanisms. Synthetic antioxidants have been in use as food additives for a long time, but reports on their involvement in chronic diseases have restricted their use in foods (Aghdam et al.,2011;Valko et al., 2007).Trace elements present in the kolakhar may also be an added advantage for the human health. These trace metals are essential minerals, and they play a vital role in our body function. The bio antacid activity of Kolakhar may be attributed to its high alkalinity which is mainly due to its alkali element such as potassium, sodium, calcium, carbonate, chloride etc. The ash of banana plant can directly be used as a potassium-type fertilizer for agricultural purpose in acidic soil.",
