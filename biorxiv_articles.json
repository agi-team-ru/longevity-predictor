    "title": "Improved management facilitates return of an iconic fish species",
    "abstract": "Species declines and losses of biota are often associated with shifting baselines in perceived historical abundances, and/or neglect or abandonment of recovery actions aimed at ecological restoration. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in the geographical distribution of the species, with associated negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we show using citizen science and other data that after 50-60 years of near total absence, the iconic top predator and highly migratory species bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, returned by the hundreds if not thousands in waters near Denmark, Norway and Sweden during August-October 2015-2017. The re-utilisation of this former habitat is part of a geographically more widespread expansion of the summer foraging area to the northern part of the northeast Atlantic Ocean, encompassing waters from east Greenland to west Sweden. The remarkable return to the Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea has been facilitated by improved fishery management for bluefin tuna and its prey. Bluefin tuna biomass in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean has been increasing since a recovery plan was implemented in the late 2000s, and biomasses of two key prey species (herring, Clupea harengus; mackerel, Scomber scombrus) recovered during the late 1980s-1990s. The reappearance of bluefin tuna in the Skagerrak-Kattegat and other waters of northern Europe, despite a recent history of mismanagement and illegal fishing in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean which led to a critical population decline, offers hope that other marine ecological recoveries are possible under improved management of fisheries and ecosystems.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryImproved management promotes the return of an ocean icon to northern Europe.\n\nSignificance StatementCommercial fisheries are often perceived being in a state of decline and collapse, putting food and economic security at risk. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in stock distribution, negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we present an example based on one of the worlds most valuable and iconic fish species, bluefin tuna, which demonstrates that effective management of both bluefin tuna and its prey has been a key factor leading to a remarkable reoccupation of formerly lost habitat. This reappearance, following decades of absence, occurred despite the bluefin tuna stock having had a recent, long history of unsustainable and illegal exploitation. Marine ecological recovery actions can be successful, even in situations which may initially appear intractable.",

    "abstract": "While performing challenging perceptual tasks such as detecting a barely visible target, our perceptual reports vary across presentations of identical stimuli. This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.",

    "abstract": "Cellular aging has been progressively elucidated by science. However, the fundamental cause of senescence--i.e., why organisms age at the multicellular-individual level--remains unclear. A recent theory of individuated multicellularity describes the emergence and growth of crucial information content for cell differentiation. This information is mostly conveyed in the non-epigenetic (i.e., transcription uncorrelated) histone crosstalk near transcription start sites. According to this theory, the non-epigenetic content emerges and grows at the expense of the information capacity for epigenetic content. If this \"reassignment\" of information capacity continues after adulthood, it may explain the senescence phenomenon. Here, I present a novel, falsifiable theory describing an uninterrupted growth of capacity for non-epigenetic information at the expense of that for epigenetic information not only during ontogeny but also throughout adulthood. As a byproduct, this continuous \"reassignment\" of capacity effectively creates an information imbalance in histone crosstalk, which in turn overregulates transcriptional levels. This overregulation is to be understood as transcriptional levels becoming more and more accurate but also less and less precise with respect to the needs of the multicellular individual--up to the point of dysfunctionality. This epigenetic/non-epigenetic information imbalance is proposed to be the primary reason why individuated multicellular organisms senesce.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.",

    "abstract": "AbstractYeast autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis are biological processes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions that usually take place in winemaking. Biological aging of Sherry wines constitutes an enological environment suitable for the induction of these mechanisms due to the scarcity of nutrients and formation of yeast social communities, i.e.; biofilm; however, few studies have been carried out in this regard. Here, we perform a proteomic analysis to detect any autolysis/autophagy/apoptosis protein markers and/or proteins potentially related to these processes under flor forming and fermentative conditions. The scarce presence of autophagy proteins in flor biofilm forming conditions, the existence of autophagy inhibitors (e.g. Pph21p), and high quantity of crucial proteins for autolysis and apoptosis, Pep4p and Mca1p, respectively; indicate that autophagy may be silenced while autolysis and apoptosis are activated when the yeasts are forming flor. This is the first time that autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis proteomes have been studied as a whole in flor yeast under film forming conditions to our knowledge.",

    "title": "Piwi mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress that promotes longevity",
    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

    "title": "Improved management facilitates return of an iconic fish species",
    "abstract": "Species declines and losses of biota are often associated with shifting baselines in perceived historical abundances, and/or neglect or abandonment of recovery actions aimed at ecological restoration. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in the geographical distribution of the species, with associated negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we show using citizen science and other data that after 50-60 years of near total absence, the iconic top predator and highly migratory species bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, returned by the hundreds if not thousands in waters near Denmark, Norway and Sweden during August-October 2015-2017. The re-utilisation of this former habitat is part of a geographically more widespread expansion of the summer foraging area to the northern part of the northeast Atlantic Ocean, encompassing waters from east Greenland to west Sweden. The remarkable return to the Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea has been facilitated by improved fishery management for bluefin tuna and its prey. Bluefin tuna biomass in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean has been increasing since a recovery plan was implemented in the late 2000s, and biomasses of two key prey species (herring, Clupea harengus; mackerel, Scomber scombrus) recovered during the late 1980s-1990s. The reappearance of bluefin tuna in the Skagerrak-Kattegat and other waters of northern Europe, despite a recent history of mismanagement and illegal fishing in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean which led to a critical population decline, offers hope that other marine ecological recoveries are possible under improved management of fisheries and ecosystems.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryImproved management promotes the return of an ocean icon to northern Europe.\n\nSignificance StatementCommercial fisheries are often perceived being in a state of decline and collapse, putting food and economic security at risk. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in stock distribution, negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we present an example based on one of the worlds most valuable and iconic fish species, bluefin tuna, which demonstrates that effective management of both bluefin tuna and its prey has been a key factor leading to a remarkable reoccupation of formerly lost habitat. This reappearance, following decades of absence, occurred despite the bluefin tuna stock having had a recent, long history of unsustainable and illegal exploitation. Marine ecological recovery actions can be successful, even in situations which may initially appear intractable.",

    "abstract": "While performing challenging perceptual tasks such as detecting a barely visible target, our perceptual reports vary across presentations of identical stimuli. This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.",

    "abstract": "Cellular aging has been progressively elucidated by science. However, the fundamental cause of senescence--i.e., why organisms age at the multicellular-individual level--remains unclear. A recent theory of individuated multicellularity describes the emergence and growth of crucial information content for cell differentiation. This information is mostly conveyed in the non-epigenetic (i.e., transcription uncorrelated) histone crosstalk near transcription start sites. According to this theory, the non-epigenetic content emerges and grows at the expense of the information capacity for epigenetic content. If this \"reassignment\" of information capacity continues after adulthood, it may explain the senescence phenomenon. Here, I present a novel, falsifiable theory describing an uninterrupted growth of capacity for non-epigenetic information at the expense of that for epigenetic information not only during ontogeny but also throughout adulthood. As a byproduct, this continuous \"reassignment\" of capacity effectively creates an information imbalance in histone crosstalk, which in turn overregulates transcriptional levels. This overregulation is to be understood as transcriptional levels becoming more and more accurate but also less and less precise with respect to the needs of the multicellular individual--up to the point of dysfunctionality. This epigenetic/non-epigenetic information imbalance is proposed to be the primary reason why individuated multicellular organisms senesce.",

    "abstract": "During neural tube patterning, a gradient of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling specifies ventral progenitor fates. The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs).

    "title": "A constraints-based theory of the primary cause of senescence: imbalance of epigenetic and non-epigenetic information in histone crosstalk",
    "abstract": "Cellular aging has been progressively elucidated by science. However, the fundamental cause of senescence--i.e., why organisms age at the multicellular-individual level--remains unclear. A recent theory of individuated multicellularity describes the emergence and growth of crucial information content for cell differentiation. This information is mostly conveyed in the non-epigenetic (i.e., transcription uncorrelated) histone crosstalk near transcription start sites. According to this theory, the non-epigenetic content emerges and grows at the expense of the information capacity for epigenetic content. If this \"reassignment\" of information capacity continues after adulthood, it may explain the senescence phenomenon. Here, I present a novel, falsifiable theory describing an uninterrupted growth of capacity for non-epigenetic information at the expense of that for epigenetic information not only during ontogeny but also throughout adulthood. As a byproduct, this continuous \"reassignment\" of capacity effectively creates an information imbalance in histone crosstalk, which in turn overregulates transcriptional levels. This overregulation is to be understood as transcriptional levels becoming more and more accurate but also less and less precise with respect to the needs of the multicellular individual--up to the point of dysfunctionality. This epigenetic/non-epigenetic information imbalance is proposed to be the primary reason why individuated multicellular organisms senesce.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.",

    "abstract": "AbstractYeast autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis are biological processes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions that usually take place in winemaking. Biological aging of Sherry wines constitutes an enological environment suitable for the induction of these mechanisms due to the scarcity of nutrients and formation of yeast social communities, i.e.; biofilm; however, few studies have been carried out in this regard. Here, we perform a proteomic analysis to detect any autolysis/autophagy/apoptosis protein markers and/or proteins potentially related to these processes under flor forming and fermentative conditions. The scarce presence of autophagy proteins in flor biofilm forming conditions, the existence of autophagy inhibitors (e.g. Pph21p), and high quantity of crucial proteins for autolysis and apoptosis, Pep4p and Mca1p, respectively; indicate that autophagy may be silenced while autolysis and apoptosis are activated when the yeasts are forming flor. This is the first time that autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis proteomes have been studied as a whole in flor yeast under film forming conditions to our knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

    "title": "Sensory experience controls dendritic structure and behavior by distinct pathways involving degenerins",
    "abstract": "Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity- dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate or by inert glass beads. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.",

    "abstract": "Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity- dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate or by inert glass beads. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.",

    "title": "A constraints-based theory of the primary cause of senescence: imbalance of epigenetic and non-epigenetic information in histone crosstalk",
    "abstract": "Cellular aging has been progressively elucidated by science. However, the fundamental cause of senescence--i.e., why organisms age at the multicellular-individual level--remains unclear. A recent theory of individuated multicellularity describes the emergence and growth of crucial information content for cell differentiation. This information is mostly conveyed in the non-epigenetic (i.e., transcription uncorrelated) histone crosstalk near transcription start sites. According to this theory, the non-epigenetic content emerges and grows at the expense of the information capacity for epigenetic content. If this \"reassignment\" of information capacity continues after adulthood, it may explain the senescence phenomenon. Here, I present a novel, falsifiable theory describing an uninterrupted growth of capacity for non-epigenetic information at the expense of that for epigenetic information not only during ontogeny but also throughout adulthood. As a byproduct, this continuous \"reassignment\" of capacity effectively creates an information imbalance in histone crosstalk, which in turn overregulates transcriptional levels. This overregulation is to be understood as transcriptional levels becoming more and more accurate but also less and less precise with respect to the needs of the multicellular individual--up to the point of dysfunctionality. This epigenetic/non-epigenetic information imbalance is proposed to be the primary reason why individuated multicellular organisms senesce.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.",

    "abstract": "AbstractYeast autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis are biological processes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions that usually take place in winemaking. Biological aging of Sherry wines constitutes an enological environment suitable for the induction of these mechanisms due to the scarcity of nutrients and formation of yeast social communities, i.e.; biofilm; however, few studies have been carried out in this regard. Here, we perform a proteomic analysis to detect any autolysis/autophagy/apoptosis protein markers and/or proteins potentially related to these processes under flor forming and fermentative conditions. The scarce presence of autophagy proteins in flor biofilm forming conditions, the existence of autophagy inhibitors (e.g. Pph21p), and high quantity of crucial proteins for autolysis and apoptosis, Pep4p and Mca1p, respectively; indicate that autophagy may be silenced while autolysis and apoptosis are activated when the yeasts are forming flor. This is the first time that autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis proteomes have been studied as a whole in flor yeast under film forming conditions to our knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

    "abstract": "During neural tube patterning, a gradient of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling specifies ventral progenitor fates. The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs). Our results highlight the precision limit of morphogen-interpretation GRNs in small and dynamic target cell fields.",

    "abstract": "We define an endogenous small RNA pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that protects telomeres via Dicer, the perinuclear Argonaute protein WAGO-1, the nuclear Argonaute protein HRDE-1, and the HP1 protein HPL-2 that stabilizes the heterochromatin mark H3K9me2. Loss of telomerase induces biogenesis of subtelomeric small RNAs, whereas loss of both telomerase and small RNA-mediated genome silencing induces expression of the telomeric lncRNA TERRA, DNA damage, and accelerated sterility. These phenotypes were rescued by exogenous telomeric small RNAs and by loss of the DNA damage response protein EXO-1. Although ATRX promotes heterochromatin deposition and is lost in human tumors that maintain their telomeres via ALT, we detected only a modest role for the C. elegans ATRX ortholog XNP-1 in telomere protection in the absence of telomerase. Moreover, neither XNP-1 nor small RNA factors that promote telomere stability in the absence of telomerase repress ALT in C. elegans.

    "title": "Small RNA-mediated genomic silencing promotes telomere stability in the absence of telomerase in C. elegans",
    "abstract": "We define an endogenous small RNA pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that protects telomeres via Dicer, the perinuclear Argonaute protein WAGO-1, the nuclear Argonaute protein HRDE-1, and the HP1 protein HPL-2 that stabilizes the heterochromatin mark H3K9me2. Loss of telomerase induces biogenesis of subtelomeric small RNAs, whereas loss of both telomerase and small RNA-mediated genome silencing induces expression of the telomeric lncRNA TERRA, DNA damage, and accelerated sterility. These phenotypes were rescued by exogenous telomeric small RNAs and by loss of the DNA damage response protein EXO-1. Although ATRX promotes heterochromatin deposition and is lost in human tumors that maintain their telomeres via ALT, we detected only a modest role for the C. elegans ATRX ortholog XNP-1 in telomere protection in the absence of telomerase. Moreover, neither XNP-1 nor small RNA factors that promote telomere stability in the absence of telomerase repress ALT in C. elegans. We propose that small RNA-mediated heterochromatin formation and telomerase function redundantly to repress a form of telomeric DNA damage that induces TERRA expression.

    "title": "A constraints-based theory of the primary cause of senescence: imbalance of epigenetic and non-epigenetic information in histone crosstalk",
    "abstract": "Cellular aging has been progressively elucidated by science. However, the fundamental cause of senescence--i.e., why organisms age at the multicellular-individual level--remains unclear. A recent theory of individuated multicellularity describes the emergence and growth of crucial information content for cell differentiation. This information is mostly conveyed in the non-epigenetic (i.e., transcription uncorrelated) histone crosstalk near transcription start sites. According to this theory, the non-epigenetic content emerges and grows at the expense of the information capacity for epigenetic content. If this \"reassignment\" of information capacity continues after adulthood, it may explain the senescence phenomenon. Here, I present a novel, falsifiable theory describing an uninterrupted growth of capacity for non-epigenetic information at the expense of that for epigenetic information not only during ontogeny but also throughout adulthood. As a byproduct, this continuous \"reassignment\" of capacity effectively creates an information imbalance in histone crosstalk, which in turn overregulates transcriptional levels. This overregulation is to be understood as transcriptional levels becoming more and more accurate but also less and less precise with respect to the needs of the multicellular individual--up to the point of dysfunctionality. This epigenetic/non-epigenetic information imbalance is proposed to be the primary reason why individuated multicellular organisms senesce.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.",

    "abstract": "AbstractYeast autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis are biological processes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions that usually take place in winemaking. Biological aging of Sherry wines constitutes an enological environment suitable for the induction of these mechanisms due to the scarcity of nutrients and formation of yeast social communities, i.e.; biofilm; however, few studies have been carried out in this regard. Here, we perform a proteomic analysis to detect any autolysis/autophagy/apoptosis protein markers and/or proteins potentially related to these processes under flor forming and fermentative conditions. The scarce presence of autophagy proteins in flor biofilm forming conditions, the existence of autophagy inhibitors (e.g. Pph21p), and high quantity of crucial proteins for autolysis and apoptosis, Pep4p and Mca1p, respectively; indicate that autophagy may be silenced while autolysis and apoptosis are activated when the yeasts are forming flor. This is the first time that autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis proteomes have been studied as a whole in flor yeast under film forming conditions to our knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

    "abstract": "During neural tube patterning, a gradient of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling specifies ventral progenitor fates. The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs). Our results highlight the precision limit of morphogen-interpretation GRNs in small and dynamic target cell fields.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control refers to brain processes involved in regulating behavior according to internal goals or plans. This study examines whether hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during paced movements shows a pattern of spatial and temporal selectivity required for cognitive control. Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was recorded from thirteen right-handed subjects during a paced, non-mnemonic (repetitive tapping) motor task. Direct and inverse connectivity in sensorimotor cortex were examined from psychophysiological interactions (PPI) from hippocampal seed activity during two sets of analyses: the first identified motor interactions relative to rest, whereas the second identified interactions in motor activity between fingers. Finger representations identified in a previous study were used to evaluate patterns of temporal and spatial selectivity in hippocampal connectivity. Changes in the magnitude of connectivity were identified within the sensorimotor representations of the first (index) through third (ring) fingers across time periods when each finger moved; at each finger representation, hippocampal connectivity was greatest when the represented finger was moving, reflecting temporal selectivity for the timing of finger movements. Similarly, the seeds associated with each finger representation differed in their magnitude of connectivity for adjacent finger representations, reflecting spatial selectivity for the moving finger. The patterns of spatial and temporal selectivity of connectivity during volitional movements in this study meets the criteria for cognitive control adapted from oculomotor studies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.",

    "title": "Detection of protein markers for autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis processes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine flor yeast strain when forming biofilm",
    "abstract": "AbstractYeast autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis are biological processes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions that usually take place in winemaking. Biological aging of Sherry wines constitutes an enological environment suitable for the induction of these mechanisms due to the scarcity of nutrients and formation of yeast social communities, i.e.; biofilm; however, few studies have been carried out in this regard. Here, we perform a proteomic analysis to detect any autolysis/autophagy/apoptosis protein markers and/or proteins potentially related to these processes under flor forming and fermentative conditions. The scarce presence of autophagy proteins in flor biofilm forming conditions, the existence of autophagy inhibitors (e.g. Pph21p), and high quantity of crucial proteins for autolysis and apoptosis, Pep4p and Mca1p, respectively; indicate that autophagy may be silenced while autolysis and apoptosis are activated when the yeasts are forming flor. This is the first time that autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis proteomes have been studied as a whole in flor yeast under film forming conditions to our knowledge.",

    "title": "Piwi mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress that promotes longevity",
    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

    "abstract": "During neural tube patterning, a gradient of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling specifies ventral progenitor fates. The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs). Our results highlight the precision limit of morphogen-interpretation GRNs in small and dynamic target cell fields.",

    "title": "Mapping viscosity in discrete subcellular locations with a BODIPY based fluorescent probe",
    "abstract": "Numerous cellular processes, including enzyme behaviour, signalling, and protein folding and transport are highly influenced by the local microviscosity environment within living cells. Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that respond to the viscosity of their environment through changes in both the intensity and lifetime of their fluorescence. We have synthesised a novel benzyl-guanine derivatized boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPYs usefulness in studying both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. These results highlight targeted BG-BODIPYs broad usefulness for making measurements of cellular viscosity both with FLIM and conventional ratiometric confocal microscopy, the latter option greatly extending the accessibility of the technique although limited to relative meassurements.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLocal viscosity affects molecular behaviour from diffusion and conformational changes to enzyme kinetics and has important implications for cell and tissue function. Mechanical methods for measurement of viscosity average over large volumes and long times and are thus unsuitable for rapid changes on small scales that are biologically relevant. This paper reports a novel optical fluorescence method using genome edited cells to deliver a viscosity reporter to tightly defined locations inside living cells, from which non-destructive organelle-specific measurements can be repeatedly made. The local viscosity of seven separate organelles in living cultured human cells is shown for the first time, together with the viscosity behaviour of a membraneless organelle as it is induced in cells by stress.",

    "title": "Detection of protein markers for autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis processes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine flor yeast strain when forming biofilm",
    "abstract": "AbstractYeast autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis are biological processes triggered by nutrient starvation conditions that usually take place in winemaking. Biological aging of Sherry wines constitutes an enological environment suitable for the induction of these mechanisms due to the scarcity of nutrients and formation of yeast social communities, i.e.; biofilm; however, few studies have been carried out in this regard. Here, we perform a proteomic analysis to detect any autolysis/autophagy/apoptosis protein markers and/or proteins potentially related to these processes under flor forming and fermentative conditions. The scarce presence of autophagy proteins in flor biofilm forming conditions, the existence of autophagy inhibitors (e.g. Pph21p), and high quantity of crucial proteins for autolysis and apoptosis, Pep4p and Mca1p, respectively; indicate that autophagy may be silenced while autolysis and apoptosis are activated when the yeasts are forming flor. This is the first time that autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis proteomes have been studied as a whole in flor yeast under film forming conditions to our knowledge.",

    "title": "Piwi mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress that promotes longevity",
    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs).

    "abstract": "Cognitive control refers to brain processes involved in regulating behavior according to internal goals or plans. This study examines whether hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during paced movements shows a pattern of spatial and temporal selectivity required for cognitive control. Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was recorded from thirteen right-handed subjects during a paced, non-mnemonic (repetitive tapping) motor task. Direct and inverse connectivity in sensorimotor cortex were examined from psychophysiological interactions (PPI) from hippocampal seed activity during two sets of analyses: the first identified motor interactions relative to rest, whereas the second identified interactions in motor activity between fingers. Finger representations identified in a previous study were used to evaluate patterns of temporal and spatial selectivity in hippocampal connectivity. Changes in the magnitude of connectivity were identified within the sensorimotor representations of the first (index) through third (ring) fingers across time periods when each finger moved; at each finger representation, hippocampal connectivity was greatest when the represented finger was moving, reflecting temporal selectivity for the timing of finger movements. Similarly, the seeds associated with each finger representation differed in their magnitude of connectivity for adjacent finger representations, reflecting spatial selectivity for the moving finger. The patterns of spatial and temporal selectivity of connectivity during volitional movements in this study meets the criteria for cognitive control adapted from oculomotor studies.",

    "abstract": "Numerous cellular processes, including enzyme behaviour, signalling, and protein folding and transport are highly influenced by the local microviscosity environment within living cells. Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that respond to the viscosity of their environment through changes in both the intensity and lifetime of their fluorescence. We have synthesised a novel benzyl-guanine derivatized boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPYs usefulness in studying both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. These results highlight targeted BG-BODIPYs broad usefulness for making measurements of cellular viscosity both with FLIM and conventional ratiometric confocal microscopy, the latter option greatly extending the accessibility of the technique although limited to relative meassurements.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLocal viscosity affects molecular behaviour from diffusion and conformational changes to enzyme kinetics and has important implications for cell and tissue function. Mechanical methods for measurement of viscosity average over large volumes and long times and are thus unsuitable for rapid changes on small scales that are biologically relevant. This paper reports a novel optical fluorescence method using genome edited cells to deliver a viscosity reporter to tightly defined locations inside living cells, from which non-destructive organelle-specific measurements can be repeatedly made. The local viscosity of seven separate organelles in living cultured human cells is shown for the first time, together with the viscosity behaviour of a membraneless organelle as it is induced in cells by stress.",

The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs).

The amplitude of NCs is proportional to functional connectivity in the network, and we find that they are robust, reproducible statistical measures, and are remarkably similar across stimuli, thus providing effective constraints to network models. We used these NCs to measure the statistics of functional connectivity among tuning classes of neurons in V1 and HVAs. Using a data-driven clustering approach, we identify approximately 60 distinct tuning classes found in V1 and HVAs. We find that NCs are higher between neurons from the same tuning class, both within and across cortical areas. Thus, in the V1-HVA network, mixing of channels is avoided. Instead, distinct channels of visual information are broadcast within and across cortical areas, at both the micron and millimeter length scales.

    "abstract": "Cognitive control refers to brain processes involved in regulating behavior according to internal goals or plans. This study examines whether hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during paced movements shows a pattern of spatial and temporal selectivity required for cognitive control. Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was recorded from thirteen right-handed subjects during a paced, non-mnemonic (repetitive tapping) motor task. Direct and inverse connectivity in sensorimotor cortex were examined from psychophysiological interactions (PPI) from hippocampal seed activity during two sets of analyses: the first identified motor interactions relative to rest, whereas the second identified interactions in motor activity between fingers. Finger representations identified in a previous study were used to evaluate patterns of temporal and spatial selectivity in hippocampal connectivity. Changes in the magnitude of connectivity were identified within the sensorimotor representations of the first (index) through third (ring) fingers across time periods when each finger moved; at each finger representation, hippocampal connectivity was greatest when the represented finger was moving, reflecting temporal selectivity for the timing of finger movements. Similarly, the seeds associated with each finger representation differed in their magnitude of connectivity for adjacent finger representations, reflecting spatial selectivity for the moving finger. The patterns of spatial and temporal selectivity of connectivity during volitional movements in this study meets the criteria for cognitive control adapted from oculomotor studies.",

    "title": "Mapping viscosity in discrete subcellular locations with a BODIPY based fluorescent probe",
    "abstract": "Numerous cellular processes, including enzyme behaviour, signalling, and protein folding and transport are highly influenced by the local microviscosity environment within living cells. Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that respond to the viscosity of their environment through changes in both the intensity and lifetime of their fluorescence. We have synthesised a novel benzyl-guanine derivatized boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPYs usefulness in studying both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. These results highlight targeted BG-BODIPYs broad usefulness for making measurements of cellular viscosity both with FLIM and conventional ratiometric confocal microscopy, the latter option greatly extending the accessibility of the technique although limited to relative meassurements.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLocal viscosity affects molecular behaviour from diffusion and conformational changes to enzyme kinetics and has important implications for cell and tissue function. Mechanical methods for measurement of viscosity average over large volumes and long times and are thus unsuitable for rapid changes on small scales that are biologically relevant. This paper reports a novel optical fluorescence method using genome edited cells to deliver a viscosity reporter to tightly defined locations inside living cells, from which non-destructive organelle-specific measurements can be repeatedly made. The local viscosity of seven separate organelles in living cultured human cells is shown for the first time, together with the viscosity behaviour of a membraneless organelle as it is induced in cells by stress.",

This strategy is predicted to combine the advantages of both asexuality and sexuality, but its actual consequences on the genetic diversity and species longevity are poorly understood. Androgenesis, a reproductive mode in which the offspring inherits its entire nuclear genome from the father, is often reported as a strictly clonal reproductive mode. Androgenesis is the predominant reproductive mode within the hermaphroditic, invasive lineages of the mollusk genus Corbicula. Their ability to reproduce clonally through androgenesis has been determinant in their invasive success, having colonized during the 20th century American and European freshwater systems, where they became notorious invaders with a widespread, global distribution. However, in androgenetic Corbicula clams, occasional genetic mixing between distinct lineages has also been observed when the sperm of one lineage fertilizes the oocyte of another one. Because of these occasional introgressions, the genetic relationships between Corbicula species remained unclear, and the biogeographic origins of the invasive androgenetic lineages have been challenging to identify. To address these issues, we analyzed the patterns of allele sharing for several nuclear and mitochondrial molecular markers among Corbicula individuals collected across both the native and invasive range. Our results show the occurrence of an allelic pool encompassing all Corbicula freshwater species worldwide, including sexual and androgenetic ones, which highlights the substantial genetic mixing within this genus. However, the differences in allele sharing patterns between invasive lineages, and the low diversity within each lineage, suggest recent, distinct biogeographic origins of invasive Corbicula androgenetic lineages. Finally, the polyploidy, high heterozygosity, and hybrid phenotypes and genotypes found in our study probably originated from hybridization events following egg parasitism between distinct Corbicula lineages. This extensive cross-lineage mixing found in Corbicula may generate nuclear diversity in an otherwise asexually reproducing species.",

Here, we assess the rules for the network consisting of the primary visual cortex and higher visual areas (V1-HVA) in mice. We use large field-of-view two-photon calcium imaging to measure correlated variability (i.e., noise correlations, NCs) among thousands of neurons, forming over a million unique pairs, distributed across multiple cortical areas simultaneously. The amplitude of NCs is proportional to functional connectivity in the network, and we find that they are robust, reproducible statistical measures, and are remarkably similar across stimuli, thus providing effective constraints to network models. We used these NCs to measure the statistics of functional connectivity among tuning classes of neurons in V1 and HVAs. Using a data-driven clustering approach, we identify approximately 60 distinct tuning classes found in V1 and HVAs. We find that NCs are higher between neurons from the same tuning class, both within and across cortical areas. Thus, in the V1-HVA network, mixing of channels is avoided. Instead, distinct channels of visual information are broadcast within and across cortical areas, at both the micron and millimeter length scales.

    "abstract": "Cognitive control refers to brain processes involved in regulating behavior according to internal goals or plans. This study examines whether hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex during paced movements shows a pattern of spatial and temporal selectivity required for cognitive control. Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was recorded from thirteen right-handed subjects during a paced, non-mnemonic (repetitive tapping) motor task. Direct and inverse connectivity in sensorimotor cortex were examined from psychophysiological interactions (PPI) from hippocampal seed activity during two sets of analyses: the first identified motor interactions relative to rest, whereas the second identified interactions in motor activity between fingers. Finger representations identified in a previous study were used to evaluate patterns of temporal and spatial selectivity in hippocampal connectivity. Changes in the magnitude of connectivity were identified within the sensorimotor representations of the first (index) through third (ring) fingers across time periods when each finger moved; at each finger representation, hippocampal connectivity was greatest when the represented finger was moving, reflecting temporal selectivity for the timing of finger movements. Similarly, the seeds associated with each finger representation differed in their magnitude of connectivity for adjacent finger representations, reflecting spatial selectivity for the moving finger. The patterns of spatial and temporal selectivity of connectivity during volitional movements in this study meets the criteria for cognitive control adapted from oculomotor studies.",

    "title": "Mapping viscosity in discrete subcellular locations with a BODIPY based fluorescent probe",
    "abstract": "Numerous cellular processes, including enzyme behaviour, signalling, and protein folding and transport are highly influenced by the local microviscosity environment within living cells. Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that respond to the viscosity of their environment through changes in both the intensity and lifetime of their fluorescence. We have synthesised a novel benzyl-guanine derivatized boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPYs usefulness in studying both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. These results highlight targeted BG-BODIPYs broad usefulness for making measurements of cellular viscosity both with FLIM and conventional ratiometric confocal microscopy, the latter option greatly extending the accessibility of the technique although limited to relative meassurements.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLocal viscosity affects molecular behaviour from diffusion and conformational changes to enzyme kinetics and has important implications for cell and tissue function. Mechanical methods for measurement of viscosity average over large volumes and long times and are thus unsuitable for rapid changes on small scales that are biologically relevant. This paper reports a novel optical fluorescence method using genome edited cells to deliver a viscosity reporter to tightly defined locations inside living cells, from which non-destructive organelle-specific measurements can be repeatedly made. The local viscosity of seven separate organelles in living cultured human cells is shown for the first time, together with the viscosity behaviour of a membraneless organelle as it is induced in cells by stress.",

This strategy is predicted to combine the advantages of both asexuality and sexuality, but its actual consequences on the genetic diversity and species longevity are poorly understood. Androgenesis, a reproductive mode in which the offspring inherits its entire nuclear genome from the father, is often reported as a strictly clonal reproductive mode. Androgenesis is the predominant reproductive mode within the hermaphroditic, invasive lineages of the mollusk genus Corbicula. Their ability to reproduce clonally through androgenesis has been determinant in their invasive success, having colonized during the 20th century American and European freshwater systems, where they became notorious invaders with a widespread, global distribution. However, in androgenetic Corbicula clams, occasional genetic mixing between distinct lineages has also been observed when the sperm of one lineage fertilizes the oocyte of another one. Because of these occasional introgressions, the genetic relationships between Corbicula species remained unclear, and the biogeographic origins of the invasive androgenetic lineages have been challenging to identify. To address these issues, we analyzed the patterns of allele sharing for several nuclear and mitochondrial molecular markers among Corbicula individuals collected across both the native and invasive range. Our results show the occurrence of an allelic pool encompassing all Corbicula freshwater species worldwide, including sexual and androgenetic ones, which highlights the substantial genetic mixing within this genus. However, the differences in allele sharing patterns between invasive lineages, and the low diversity within each lineage, suggest recent, distinct biogeographic origins of invasive Corbicula androgenetic lineages. Finally, the polyploidy, high heterozygosity, and hybrid phenotypes and genotypes found in our study probably originated from hybridization events following egg parasitism between distinct Corbicula lineages.

    "abstract": "Diffraction-unlimited single-molecule techniques like STORM and (F)PALM enable three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging at tens of nanometer resolution and are invaluable to investigate sub-cellular organization. The multitude of camera frames required to reconstruct a super-resolved image limits the typical throughput of these techniques to tens of cells per day, rendering these methods incompatible with large-scale cell biological or clinical application. STORM acquisition rates can be increased by over an order of magnitude, however the data volumes of about 40 TB a day and concomitant analysis burdens exceed the capacity of existing workflows. Here we present an integrated platform which transforms SMLM from a trick-pony technique into a work horse for cell biology. We leverage our developments in microscopy-specific data compression, distributed storage, and distributed analysis to automatically perform real-time localization analysis, which enable SMLM at throughputs of 10,000 cells a day. We implemented these advances in a fully-integrated environment that supports a highly-flexible architecture for distributed analysis, enabling quickly- and graphically-reconfigurable analyses to be automatically initiated from the microscope during acquisition, remotely executed, and even feedback and queue new acquisition tasks on the microscope. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by imaging hundreds of cells per well in multi-well sample formats. Our platform, the PYthon-Microscopy Environment (PYME), is easily configurable for hardware control on custom microscopes, and includes a plugin framework so users can readily extend all components of their imaging, visualization, and analysis pipeline. PYME is cross-platform, open source, and efficiently puts high-caliber visualization and analysis tools into the hands of both microscope developers and users.",

    "abstract": "Aging in postmitotic tissues is associated with clonal expansion of somatic mitochondrial deletions, the origin of which is not well understood. Deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are often flanked by direct nucleotide repeats, but this alone does not fully explain their distribution. Here, we hypothesized that the close proximity of direct repeats on single-stranded DNA might play a role in the formation of deletions. By analyzing human mtDNA deletions in the major arc of mtDNA, which is single-stranded during replication and is characterized by a high number of deletions, we found a non-uniform distribution with a \"hot spot\" where one deletion breakpoint occurred within the region of 6-9kb and another within 13-16kb of the mtDNA. This distribution was not explained by the presence of direct repeats, suggesting that other factors, such as the spatial proximity of these two regions can be the cause. In silico analyses revealed that the single-stranded major arc may be organized as a large-scale hairpin-like loop with a center close to 11kb and contacting regions between 6-9 kb and 13-16 kb, which would explain the high deletion activity in this contact zone. The direct repeats located within the contact zone, such as the well-known common repeat with a first arm at 8470-8482 bp and a second arm at 13447-13459 bp, are three times more likely to cause deletions compared to direct repeats located outside of the contact zone. An analysis of age- and disease-associated deletions demonstrated that the contact zone plays a crucial role in explaining the age-associated deletions, emphasizing its importance in the rate of healthy aging. Overall, we provide topological insights into the mechanism of age-associated deletion formation in human mtDNA, which could be used to predict somatic deletion burden and maximum lifespan in different human haplogroups and mammalian species.",

In silico analyses revealed that the single-stranded major arc may be organized as a large-scale hairpin-like loop with a center close to 11kb and contacting regions between 6-9 kb and 13-16 kb, which would explain the high deletion activity in this contact zone. The direct repeats located within the contact zone, such as the well-known common repeat with a first arm at 8470-8482 bp and a second arm at 13447-13459 bp, are three times more likely to cause deletions compared to direct repeats located outside of the contact zone. An analysis of age- and disease-associated deletions demonstrated that the contact zone plays a crucial role in explaining the age-associated deletions, emphasizing its importance in the rate of healthy aging. Overall, we provide topological insights into the mechanism of age-associated deletion formation in human mtDNA, which could be used to predict somatic deletion burden and maximum lifespan in different human haplogroups and mammalian species.",

Androgenesis, a reproductive mode in which the offspring inherits its entire nuclear genome from the father, is often reported as a strictly clonal reproductive mode. Androgenesis is the predominant reproductive mode within the hermaphroditic, invasive lineages of the mollusk genus Corbicula. Their ability to reproduce clonally through androgenesis has been determinant in their invasive success, having colonized during the 20th century American and European freshwater systems, where they became notorious invaders with a widespread, global distribution. However, in androgenetic Corbicula clams, occasional genetic mixing between distinct lineages has also been observed when the sperm of one lineage fertilizes the oocyte of another one. Because of these occasional introgressions, the genetic relationships between Corbicula species remained unclear, and the biogeographic origins of the invasive androgenetic lineages have been challenging to identify. To address these issues, we analyzed the patterns of allele sharing for several nuclear and mitochondrial molecular markers among Corbicula individuals collected across both the native and invasive range. Our results show the occurrence of an allelic pool encompassing all Corbicula freshwater species worldwide, including sexual and androgenetic ones, which highlights the substantial genetic mixing within this genus.

    "abstract": "Diffraction-unlimited single-molecule techniques like STORM and (F)PALM enable three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging at tens of nanometer resolution and are invaluable to investigate sub-cellular organization. The multitude of camera frames required to reconstruct a super-resolved image limits the typical throughput of these techniques to tens of cells per day, rendering these methods incompatible with large-scale cell biological or clinical application. STORM acquisition rates can be increased by over an order of magnitude, however the data volumes of about 40 TB a day and concomitant analysis burdens exceed the capacity of existing workflows. Here we present an integrated platform which transforms SMLM from a trick-pony technique into a work horse for cell biology. We leverage our developments in microscopy-specific data compression, distributed storage, and distributed analysis to automatically perform real-time localization analysis, which enable SMLM at throughputs of 10,000 cells a day. We implemented these advances in a fully-integrated environment that supports a highly-flexible architecture for distributed analysis, enabling quickly- and graphically-reconfigurable analyses to be automatically initiated from the microscope during acquisition, remotely executed, and even feedback and queue new acquisition tasks on the microscope. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by imaging hundreds of cells per well in multi-well sample formats. Our platform, the PYthon-Microscopy Environment (PYME), is easily configurable for hardware control on custom microscopes, and includes a plugin framework so users can readily extend all components of their imaging, visualization, and analysis pipeline. PYME is cross-platform, open source, and efficiently puts high-caliber visualization and analysis tools into the hands of both microscope developers and users.",

    "title": "An essential periplasmic protein coordinates lipid trafficking and is required for asymmetric polar growth in mycobacteria",
    "abstract": "Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - lamA - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lamA. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.",

Here we present an integrated platform which transforms SMLM from a trick-pony technique into a work horse for cell biology. We leverage our developments in microscopy-specific data compression, distributed storage, and distributed analysis to automatically perform real-time localization analysis, which enable SMLM at throughputs of 10,000 cells a day. We implemented these advances in a fully-integrated environment that supports a highly-flexible architecture for distributed analysis, enabling quickly- and graphically-reconfigurable analyses to be automatically initiated from the microscope during acquisition, remotely executed, and even feedback and queue new acquisition tasks on the microscope. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by imaging hundreds of cells per well in multi-well sample formats. Our platform, the PYthon-Microscopy Environment (PYME), is easily configurable for hardware control on custom microscopes, and includes a plugin framework so users can readily extend all components of their imaging, visualization, and analysis pipeline.

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - lamA - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lamA. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.",

Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that respond to the viscosity of their environment through changes in both the intensity and lifetime of their fluorescence. We have synthesised a novel benzyl-guanine derivatized boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPYs usefulness in studying both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles.

    "title": "Transcranial focused ultrasound to rIFG improves response inhibition through modulation of the P300 onset latency",
    "abstract": "Response inhibition is important to avoid undesirable behavioral action consequences. Neuroimaging and lesion studies point to a locus of inhibitory control in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrophysiology studies have implicated a downstream event-related potential from rIFG, the fronto-central P300, as a putative neural marker of the success and timing of inhibition over behavioral responses. However, it remains to be established whether rIFG effectively drives inhibition as represented by the P300 activity, and whether rIFG contributions to inhibition are conveyed through either the P300 timing or amplitude. Here, we aimed to causally uncover the connection between rIFG and P300 for inhibition by using transcranial focused ultrasound (tfUS) to target rIFG of human subjects while they performed a Stop-Signal task. By applying tFUS simultaneous with different task events, we found behavioral inhibition was improved only when applied to rIFG simultaneous with a  stop signal. Applying tFUS simultaneous with the  go signal or control regions had no impact on behavior. The improvement in inhibition performance caused by tFUS to rIFG during stop conditions occurred through faster stopping times that were paired with significantly shorter P300 latencies, whereas amplitude was not affected. These results reveal a causal connection between rIFG in driving response inhibition in that it may regulate the speed of stopping directly, as indexed by the reduced P300 onset latency during tFUS. Our tFUS-EEG approach provides a causal connection, in healthy humans, between prefrontal rIFG regions and downstream P300 production in service of inhibitory control.",

We have synthesised a novel benzyl-guanine derivatized boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPYs usefulness in studying both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. These results highlight targeted BG-BODIPYs broad usefulness for making measurements of cellular viscosity both with FLIM and conventional ratiometric confocal microscopy, the latter option greatly extending the accessibility of the technique although limited to relative meassurements.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLocal viscosity affects molecular behaviour from diffusion and conformational changes to enzyme kinetics and has important implications for cell and tissue function. Mechanical methods for measurement of viscosity average over large volumes and long times and are thus unsuitable for rapid changes on small scales that are biologically relevant. This paper reports a novel optical fluorescence method using genome edited cells to deliver a viscosity reporter to tightly defined locations inside living cells, from which non-destructive organelle-specific measurements can be repeatedly made. The local viscosity of seven separate organelles in living cultured human cells is shown for the first time, together with the viscosity behaviour of a membraneless organelle as it is induced in cells by stress.",

    "abstract": "Diffraction-unlimited single-molecule techniques like STORM and (F)PALM enable three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging at tens of nanometer resolution and are invaluable to investigate sub-cellular organization. The multitude of camera frames required to reconstruct a super-resolved image limits the typical throughput of these techniques to tens of cells per day, rendering these methods incompatible with large-scale cell biological or clinical application. STORM acquisition rates can be increased by over an order of magnitude, however the data volumes of about 40 TB a day and concomitant analysis burdens exceed the capacity of existing workflows. Here we present an integrated platform which transforms SMLM from a trick-pony technique into a work horse for cell biology. We leverage our developments in microscopy-specific data compression, distributed storage, and distributed analysis to automatically perform real-time localization analysis, which enable SMLM at throughputs of 10,000 cells a day. We implemented these advances in a fully-integrated environment that supports a highly-flexible architecture for distributed analysis, enabling quickly- and graphically-reconfigurable analyses to be automatically initiated from the microscope during acquisition, remotely executed, and even feedback and queue new acquisition tasks on the microscope. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by imaging hundreds of cells per well in multi-well sample formats. Our platform, the PYthon-Microscopy Environment (PYME), is easily configurable for hardware control on custom microscopes, and includes a plugin framework so users can readily extend all components of their imaging, visualization, and analysis pipeline. PYME is cross-platform, open source, and efficiently puts high-caliber visualization and analysis tools into the hands of both microscope developers and users.",

    "abstract": "Aging in postmitotic tissues is associated with clonal expansion of somatic mitochondrial deletions, the origin of which is not well understood. Deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are often flanked by direct nucleotide repeats, but this alone does not fully explain their distribution. Here, we hypothesized that the close proximity of direct repeats on single-stranded DNA might play a role in the formation of deletions. By analyzing human mtDNA deletions in the major arc of mtDNA, which is single-stranded during replication and is characterized by a high number of deletions, we found a non-uniform distribution with a \"hot spot\" where one deletion breakpoint occurred within the region of 6-9kb and another within 13-16kb of the mtDNA. This distribution was not explained by the presence of direct repeats, suggesting that other factors, such as the spatial proximity of these two regions can be the cause. In silico analyses revealed that the single-stranded major arc may be organized as a large-scale hairpin-like loop with a center close to 11kb and contacting regions between 6-9 kb and 13-16 kb, which would explain the high deletion activity in this contact zone. The direct repeats located within the contact zone, such as the well-known common repeat with a first arm at 8470-8482 bp and a second arm at 13447-13459 bp, are three times more likely to cause deletions compared to direct repeats located outside of the contact zone. An analysis of age- and disease-associated deletions demonstrated that the contact zone plays a crucial role in explaining the age-associated deletions, emphasizing its importance in the rate of healthy aging. Overall, we provide topological insights into the mechanism of age-associated deletion formation in human mtDNA, which could be used to predict somatic deletion burden and maximum lifespan in different human haplogroups and mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - lamA - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lamA. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition is important to avoid undesirable behavioral action consequences. Neuroimaging and lesion studies point to a locus of inhibitory control in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrophysiology studies have implicated a downstream event-related potential from rIFG, the fronto-central P300, as a putative neural marker of the success and timing of inhibition over behavioral responses. However, it remains to be established whether rIFG effectively drives inhibition as represented by the P300 activity, and whether rIFG contributions to inhibition are conveyed through either the P300 timing or amplitude. Here, we aimed to causally uncover the connection between rIFG and P300 for inhibition by using transcranial focused ultrasound (tfUS) to target rIFG of human subjects while they performed a Stop-Signal task. By applying tFUS simultaneous with different task events, we found behavioral inhibition was improved only when applied to rIFG simultaneous with a  stop signal. Applying tFUS simultaneous with the  go signal or control regions had no impact on behavior. The improvement in inhibition performance caused by tFUS to rIFG during stop conditions occurred through faster stopping times that were paired with significantly shorter P300 latencies, whereas amplitude was not affected. These results reveal a causal connection between rIFG in driving response inhibition in that it may regulate the speed of stopping directly, as indexed by the reduced P300 onset latency during tFUS. Our tFUS-EEG approach provides a causal connection, in healthy humans, between prefrontal rIFG regions and downstream P300 production in service of inhibitory control.",

    "abstract": "Diffraction-unlimited single-molecule techniques like STORM and (F)PALM enable three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging at tens of nanometer resolution and are invaluable to investigate sub-cellular organization. The multitude of camera frames required to reconstruct a super-resolved image limits the typical throughput of these techniques to tens of cells per day, rendering these methods incompatible with large-scale cell biological or clinical application. STORM acquisition rates can be increased by over an order of magnitude, however the data volumes of about 40 TB a day and concomitant analysis burdens exceed the capacity of existing workflows. Here we present an integrated platform which transforms SMLM from a trick-pony technique into a work horse for cell biology. We leverage our developments in microscopy-specific data compression, distributed storage, and distributed analysis to automatically perform real-time localization analysis, which enable SMLM at throughputs of 10,000 cells a day. We implemented these advances in a fully-integrated environment that supports a highly-flexible architecture for distributed analysis, enabling quickly- and graphically-reconfigurable analyses to be automatically initiated from the microscope during acquisition, remotely executed, and even feedback and queue new acquisition tasks on the microscope. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by imaging hundreds of cells per well in multi-well sample formats. Our platform, the PYthon-Microscopy Environment (PYME), is easily configurable for hardware control on custom microscopes, and includes a plugin framework so users can readily extend all components of their imaging, visualization, and analysis pipeline. PYME is cross-platform, open source, and efficiently puts high-caliber visualization and analysis tools into the hands of both microscope developers and users.",

    "abstract": "Aging in postmitotic tissues is associated with clonal expansion of somatic mitochondrial deletions, the origin of which is not well understood. Deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are often flanked by direct nucleotide repeats, but this alone does not fully explain their distribution. Here, we hypothesized that the close proximity of direct repeats on single-stranded DNA might play a role in the formation of deletions. By analyzing human mtDNA deletions in the major arc of mtDNA, which is single-stranded during replication and is characterized by a high number of deletions, we found a non-uniform distribution with a \"hot spot\" where one deletion breakpoint occurred within the region of 6-9kb and another within 13-16kb of the mtDNA. This distribution was not explained by the presence of direct repeats, suggesting that other factors, such as the spatial proximity of these two regions can be the cause. In silico analyses revealed that the single-stranded major arc may be organized as a large-scale hairpin-like loop with a center close to 11kb and contacting regions between 6-9 kb and 13-16 kb, which would explain the high deletion activity in this contact zone. The direct repeats located within the contact zone, such as the well-known common repeat with a first arm at 8470-8482 bp and a second arm at 13447-13459 bp, are three times more likely to cause deletions compared to direct repeats located outside of the contact zone. An analysis of age- and disease-associated deletions demonstrated that the contact zone plays a crucial role in explaining the age-associated deletions, emphasizing its importance in the rate of healthy aging. Overall, we provide topological insights into the mechanism of age-associated deletion formation in human mtDNA, which could be used to predict somatic deletion burden and maximum lifespan in different human haplogroups and mammalian species.",

    "title": "An essential periplasmic protein coordinates lipid trafficking and is required for asymmetric polar growth in mycobacteria",
    "abstract": "Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - lamA - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lamA. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition is important to avoid undesirable behavioral action consequences. Neuroimaging and lesion studies point to a locus of inhibitory control in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrophysiology studies have implicated a downstream event-related potential from rIFG, the fronto-central P300, as a putative neural marker of the success and timing of inhibition over behavioral responses. However, it remains to be established whether rIFG effectively drives inhibition as represented by the P300 activity, and whether rIFG contributions to inhibition are conveyed through either the P300 timing or amplitude. Here, we aimed to causally uncover the connection between rIFG and P300 for inhibition by using transcranial focused ultrasound (tfUS) to target rIFG of human subjects while they performed a Stop-Signal task. By applying tFUS simultaneous with different task events, we found behavioral inhibition was improved only when applied to rIFG simultaneous with a  stop signal. Applying tFUS simultaneous with the  go signal or control regions had no impact on behavior. The improvement in inhibition performance caused by tFUS to rIFG during stop conditions occurred through faster stopping times that were paired with significantly shorter P300 latencies, whereas amplitude was not affected. These results reveal a causal connection between rIFG in driving response inhibition in that it may regulate the speed of stopping directly, as indexed by the reduced P300 onset latency during tFUS. Our tFUS-EEG approach provides a causal connection, in healthy humans, between prefrontal rIFG regions and downstream P300 production in service of inhibitory control.",

    "title": "Substantial genetic mixing among sexual and androgenetic lineages within the clam genus Corbicula",
    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOW\"Occasional\" sexuality occurs when a species combines clonal reproduction and genetic mixing. This strategy is predicted to combine the advantages of both asexuality and sexuality, but its actual consequences on the genetic diversity and species longevity are poorly understood. Androgenesis, a reproductive mode in which the offspring inherits its entire nuclear genome from the father, is often reported as a strictly clonal reproductive mode. Androgenesis is the predominant reproductive mode within the hermaphroditic, invasive lineages of the mollusk genus Corbicula. Their ability to reproduce clonally through androgenesis has been determinant in their invasive success, having colonized during the 20th century American and European freshwater systems, where they became notorious invaders with a widespread, global distribution. However, in androgenetic Corbicula clams, occasional genetic mixing between distinct lineages has also been observed when the sperm of one lineage fertilizes the oocyte of another one. Because of these occasional introgressions, the genetic relationships between Corbicula species remained unclear, and the biogeographic origins of the invasive androgenetic lineages have been challenging to identify. To address these issues, we analyzed the patterns of allele sharing for several nuclear and mitochondrial molecular markers among Corbicula individuals collected across both the native and invasive range. Our results show the occurrence of an allelic pool encompassing all Corbicula freshwater species worldwide, including sexual and androgenetic ones, which highlights the substantial genetic mixing within this genus. However, the differences in allele sharing patterns between invasive lineages, and the low diversity within each lineage, suggest recent, distinct biogeographic origins of invasive Corbicula androgenetic lineages. Finally, the polyploidy, high heterozygosity, and hybrid phenotypes and genotypes found in our study probably originated from hybridization events following egg parasitism between distinct Corbicula lineages. This extensive cross-lineage mixing found in Corbicula may generate nuclear diversity in an otherwise asexually reproducing species.",

    "abstract": "Aging in postmitotic tissues is associated with clonal expansion of somatic mitochondrial deletions, the origin of which is not well understood. Deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are often flanked by direct nucleotide repeats, but this alone does not fully explain their distribution. Here, we hypothesized that the close proximity of direct repeats on single-stranded DNA might play a role in the formation of deletions. By analyzing human mtDNA deletions in the major arc of mtDNA, which is single-stranded during replication and is characterized by a high number of deletions, we found a non-uniform distribution with a \"hot spot\" where one deletion breakpoint occurred within the region of 6-9kb and another within 13-16kb of the mtDNA. This distribution was not explained by the presence of direct repeats, suggesting that other factors, such as the spatial proximity of these two regions can be the cause. In silico analyses revealed that the single-stranded major arc may be organized as a large-scale hairpin-like loop with a center close to 11kb and contacting regions between 6-9 kb and 13-16 kb, which would explain the high deletion activity in this contact zone. The direct repeats located within the contact zone, such as the well-known common repeat with a first arm at 8470-8482 bp and a second arm at 13447-13459 bp, are three times more likely to cause deletions compared to direct repeats located outside of the contact zone. An analysis of age- and disease-associated deletions demonstrated that the contact zone plays a crucial role in explaining the age-associated deletions, emphasizing its importance in the rate of healthy aging.

    "title": "An essential periplasmic protein coordinates lipid trafficking and is required for asymmetric polar growth in mycobacteria",
    "abstract": "Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - lamA - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lamA. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition is important to avoid undesirable behavioral action consequences. Neuroimaging and lesion studies point to a locus of inhibitory control in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrophysiology studies have implicated a downstream event-related potential from rIFG, the fronto-central P300, as a putative neural marker of the success and timing of inhibition over behavioral responses. However, it remains to be established whether rIFG effectively drives inhibition as represented by the P300 activity, and whether rIFG contributions to inhibition are conveyed through either the P300 timing or amplitude. Here, we aimed to causally uncover the connection between rIFG and P300 for inhibition by using transcranial focused ultrasound (tfUS) to target rIFG of human subjects while they performed a Stop-Signal task. By applying tFUS simultaneous with different task events, we found behavioral inhibition was improved only when applied to rIFG simultaneous with a  stop signal. Applying tFUS simultaneous with the  go signal or control regions had no impact on behavior. The improvement in inhibition performance caused by tFUS to rIFG during stop conditions occurred through faster stopping times that were paired with significantly shorter P300 latencies, whereas amplitude was not affected. These results reveal a causal connection between rIFG in driving response inhibition in that it may regulate the speed of stopping directly, as indexed by the reduced P300 onset latency during tFUS. Our tFUS-EEG approach provides a causal connection, in healthy humans, between prefrontal rIFG regions and downstream P300 production in service of inhibitory control.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional and functional cellular specialization has been described for insulin-secreting {beta}-cells of the endocrine pancreas. However, it is not clear whether {beta}-cell heterogeneity is stable or reflects dynamic cellular states. We investigated the temporal kinetics of endogenous insulin gene activity using live cell imaging, with complementary experiments employing FACS and single cell RNA sequencing, in {beta}-cells from Ins2GFP knock-in mice. In vivo staining and FACS analysis of islets from Ins2GFP mice confirmed that at a given moment, ~25% of {beta}-cells exhibited significantly higher activity at the conserved insulin gene Ins2. Live cell imaging captured Ins2 gene activity dynamics in single {beta}-cells over days. Autocorrelation analysis revealed a subset of cells with oscillating behavior, with mean oscillation periods of 17 hours. Increased glucose concentrations stimulated more cells to oscillate and resulted in higher average Ins2 gene activity per cell. Single cell RNA sequencing showed that Ins2(GFP)HIGH {beta}-cells were enriched for markers of {beta}-cell maturity. Ins2(GFP)HIGH {beta}-cells were also significantly less viable at all glucose concentrations and in the context of ER stress. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the heterogeneity of insulin production, observed in mouse and human {beta}-cells, can be accounted for by dynamic states of insulin gene activity.\n\nBlurbPreviously reported pancreatic {beta}-cell heterogeneity reflects {beta}-cell state transitions.",

    "abstract": "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or  blue zones, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.",

Nevertheless, the function of the claustrum still remains unclear. We present a functional connectivity study of the claustrum in order to identify its main networks. Resting state functional and anatomical MRI data from 100 healthy subjects were analyzed; taken from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, NIH Blueprint: The Human Connectome Project), with 2x2x2 mm3 voxel resolution. Positive functional connectivity was found (p<0.05, FDR corrected) between the claustrum and the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, pre-central and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and subcortical areas. Our findings coincide with the results previously reported in both animal models and studies with humans.

This distribution was not explained by the presence of direct repeats, suggesting that other factors, such as the spatial proximity of these two regions can be the cause. In silico analyses revealed that the single-stranded major arc may be organized as a large-scale hairpin-like loop with a center close to 11kb and contacting regions between 6-9 kb and 13-16 kb, which would explain the high deletion activity in this contact zone. The direct repeats located within the contact zone, such as the well-known common repeat with a first arm at 8470-8482 bp and a second arm at 13447-13459 bp, are three times more likely to cause deletions compared to direct repeats located outside of the contact zone. An analysis of age- and disease-associated deletions demonstrated that the contact zone plays a crucial role in explaining the age-associated deletions, emphasizing its importance in the rate of healthy aging. Overall, we provide topological insights into the mechanism of age-associated deletion formation in human mtDNA, which could be used to predict somatic deletion burden and maximum lifespan in different human haplogroups and mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - lamA - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lamA. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition is important to avoid undesirable behavioral action consequences. Neuroimaging and lesion studies point to a locus of inhibitory control in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrophysiology studies have implicated a downstream event-related potential from rIFG, the fronto-central P300, as a putative neural marker of the success and timing of inhibition over behavioral responses. However, it remains to be established whether rIFG effectively drives inhibition as represented by the P300 activity, and whether rIFG contributions to inhibition are conveyed through either the P300 timing or amplitude. Here, we aimed to causally uncover the connection between rIFG and P300 for inhibition by using transcranial focused ultrasound (tfUS) to target rIFG of human subjects while they performed a Stop-Signal task. By applying tFUS simultaneous with different task events, we found behavioral inhibition was improved only when applied to rIFG simultaneous with a  stop signal. Applying tFUS simultaneous with the  go signal or control regions had no impact on behavior. The improvement in inhibition performance caused by tFUS to rIFG during stop conditions occurred through faster stopping times that were paired with significantly shorter P300 latencies, whereas amplitude was not affected. These results reveal a causal connection between rIFG in driving response inhibition in that it may regulate the speed of stopping directly, as indexed by the reduced P300 onset latency during tFUS. Our tFUS-EEG approach provides a causal connection, in healthy humans, between prefrontal rIFG regions and downstream P300 production in service of inhibitory control.",

Ins2(GFP)HIGH {beta}-cells were also significantly less viable at all glucose concentrations and in the context of ER stress.

    "abstract": "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or  blue zones, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.",

    "title": "Increased presynaptic excitability in a migraine with aura mutation",
    "abstract": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. The headache and sensory amplifications that characterize migraine are attributed to hyperexcitable sensory circuits, but a detailed understanding remains elusive. This is partly due to the paucity of genetic animal models associated with the common, less severe form of the disease. A mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) was identified in familial migraine with aura and advanced sleep phase syndrome. Spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura, is facilitated in mice carrying one of the mutations (CK1{delta}T44A). However, the mechanism of this susceptibility is not known. We used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology and imaging, in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices, to understand the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of this apparent circuit excitability. We found that despite normal synaptic activity and hyperpolarized neuronal membrane potentials at rest, CK1{delta}T44A neurons were more excitable upon repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls. This was due to reduced presynaptic adaptation to high-frequency stimuli at excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses. Reduced adaptation at glutamatergic CK1{delta}T44A synapses was mediated by a calcium-dependent enhancement of the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. This caused an increase in the cumulative amplitude of excitatory currents, and a higher excitation-to-inhibition ratio during sustained activity, both in vivo and in brain slices. Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",

    "title": "Increased presynaptic excitability in a migraine with aura mutation",
    "abstract": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. The headache and sensory amplifications that characterize migraine are attributed to hyperexcitable sensory circuits, but a detailed understanding remains elusive. This is partly due to the paucity of genetic animal models associated with the common, less severe form of the disease. A mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) was identified in familial migraine with aura and advanced sleep phase syndrome. Spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura, is facilitated in mice carrying one of the mutations (CK1{delta}T44A). However, the mechanism of this susceptibility is not known. We used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology and imaging, in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices, to understand the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of this apparent circuit excitability. We found that despite normal synaptic activity and hyperpolarized neuronal membrane potentials at rest, CK1{delta}T44A neurons were more excitable upon repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls. This was due to reduced presynaptic adaptation to high-frequency stimuli at excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses. Reduced adaptation at glutamatergic CK1{delta}T44A synapses was mediated by a calcium-dependent enhancement of the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. This caused an increase in the cumulative amplitude of excitatory currents, and a higher excitation-to-inhibition ratio during sustained activity, both in vivo and in brain slices. Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerave diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are oten associated with mutaons in proteins that are associated with stress granules. Stress granules are condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separaon which, when aberrant, can lead to altered condensaon behaviours and disease phenotypes. Here, we identified lipoamide, a small molecule which specifically prevents cytoplasmic condensaon of stress granule proteins. Thermal proteome profiling showed that lipoamide preferentially stabilises intrinsically disordered domain-containing proteins. These include SRSF1 and SFPQ, stress granule proteins necessary for lipoamide activity. The redox state of SFPQ correlates with its condensate-dissolving behaviour, in concordance with the importance of the dithiolane ring for lipoamide activity. In animals, lipoamide ameliorates aging-associated aggregaon of a stress granule reporter, improves neuronal morphology, and recovers motor defects caused by expression of ALS-associated FUS and TDP-43 mutants. In conclusion, lipoamide is a well-tolerated small molecule modulator of stress granule condensaon and dissection of its molecular mechanism identified a cellular pathway for redox regulaon of stress granule formaon.",

    "abstract": "Physiological homeostasis becomes compromised during aging, as a result of impairment of cellular processes, including transcription and RNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here, we profiled and analyzed genome-wide, aging-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematode worms, fruit flies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (Pol-II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin/Igf signaling, both reversed most of these aging-related changes. Genetic variants in Pol-II that reduced its speed in worms and flies increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing Pol-II speed by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal aging and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventative measures.",

Reduced adaptation at glutamatergic CK1{delta}T44A synapses was mediated by a calcium-dependent enhancement of the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. This caused an increase in the cumulative amplitude of excitatory currents, and a higher excitation-to-inhibition ratio during sustained activity, both in vivo and in brain slices. Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here, we profiled and analyzed genome-wide, aging-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematode worms, fruit flies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (Pol-II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin/Igf signaling, both reversed most of these aging-related changes. Genetic variants in Pol-II that reduced its speed in worms and flies increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing Pol-II speed by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells.

    "title": "Sorting motifs target the movement protein of ourmia melon virus to the trans-Golgi network and plasmodesmata",
    "abstract": "Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is delivered to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Although several functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP have been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach the PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Glycine substitutions in these motifs result in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at the PD. Taken together, these results suggest that both motifs are indispensable for targeting OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection but show differences in functionality. Co-immunoprecipitation assays coupled with mass spectrometry identified a series of host factors that could interact with the OuMV MP and link the MP with various pathways, in particular vesicle trafficking and membrane lipids. This study provides new insights into the intracellular targeting of MPs and pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.",

Recent work has shown that primary sensory areas can respond to and in some cases discriminate stimuli not of their target modality: for example, primary somatosensory cortex (SI) discriminates visual images of graspable objects. In the present work, we investigated whether SI would discriminate sounds depicting hand-object interactions (e.g. bouncing a ball). In a rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants listened attentively to sounds from three categories: hand-object interactions, and control categories of pure tones and animal vocalizations, while performing a one-back repetition detection task. Multi-voxel pattern analysis revealed significant decoding of different hand-object interactions within SI, but not for either control category. Crucially, in the hand-sensitive voxels defined from an independent tactile localizer, decoding accuracies were significantly higher for hand-object interactions compared to pure tones in left SI. Our findings indicate that simply hearing sounds depicting familiar hand-object interactions elicit different patterns of activity in SI, despite the complete absence of tactile stimulation.

    "abstract": "Response inhibition is important to avoid undesirable behavioral action consequences. Neuroimaging and lesion studies point to a locus of inhibitory control in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrophysiology studies have implicated a downstream event-related potential from rIFG, the fronto-central P300, as a putative neural marker of the success and timing of inhibition over behavioral responses. However, it remains to be established whether rIFG effectively drives inhibition as represented by the P300 activity, and whether rIFG contributions to inhibition are conveyed through either the P300 timing or amplitude. Here, we aimed to causally uncover the connection between rIFG and P300 for inhibition by using transcranial focused ultrasound (tfUS) to target rIFG of human subjects while they performed a Stop-Signal task. By applying tFUS simultaneous with different task events, we found behavioral inhibition was improved only when applied to rIFG simultaneous with a  stop signal. Applying tFUS simultaneous with the  go signal or control regions had no impact on behavior. The improvement in inhibition performance caused by tFUS to rIFG during stop conditions occurred through faster stopping times that were paired with significantly shorter P300 latencies, whereas amplitude was not affected. These results reveal a causal connection between rIFG in driving response inhibition in that it may regulate the speed of stopping directly, as indexed by the reduced P300 onset latency during tFUS. Our tFUS-EEG approach provides a causal connection, in healthy humans, between prefrontal rIFG regions and downstream P300 production in service of inhibitory control.",

The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records.

    "abstract": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. The headache and sensory amplifications that characterize migraine are attributed to hyperexcitable sensory circuits, but a detailed understanding remains elusive. This is partly due to the paucity of genetic animal models associated with the common, less severe form of the disease. A mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) was identified in familial migraine with aura and advanced sleep phase syndrome. Spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura, is facilitated in mice carrying one of the mutations (CK1{delta}T44A). However, the mechanism of this susceptibility is not known. We used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology and imaging, in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices, to understand the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of this apparent circuit excitability. We found that despite normal synaptic activity and hyperpolarized neuronal membrane potentials at rest, CK1{delta}T44A neurons were more excitable upon repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls.

Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerave diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are oten associated with mutaons in proteins that are associated with stress granules. Stress granules are condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separaon which, when aberrant, can lead to altered condensaon behaviours and disease phenotypes. Here, we identified lipoamide, a small molecule which specifically prevents cytoplasmic condensaon of stress granule proteins. Thermal proteome profiling showed that lipoamide preferentially stabilises intrinsically disordered domain-containing proteins. These include SRSF1 and SFPQ, stress granule proteins necessary for lipoamide activity. The redox state of SFPQ correlates with its condensate-dissolving behaviour, in concordance with the importance of the dithiolane ring for lipoamide activity. In animals, lipoamide ameliorates aging-associated aggregaon of a stress granule reporter, improves neuronal morphology, and recovers motor defects caused by expression of ALS-associated FUS and TDP-43 mutants. In conclusion, lipoamide is a well-tolerated small molecule modulator of stress granule condensaon and dissection of its molecular mechanism identified a cellular pathway for redox regulaon of stress granule formaon.",

    "abstract": "Physiological homeostasis becomes compromised during aging, as a result of impairment of cellular processes, including transcription and RNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here, we profiled and analyzed genome-wide, aging-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematode worms, fruit flies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (Pol-II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin/Igf signaling, both reversed most of these aging-related changes. Genetic variants in Pol-II that reduced its speed in worms and flies increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing Pol-II speed by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal aging and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventative measures.",

    "title": "Sorting motifs target the movement protein of ourmia melon virus to the trans-Golgi network and plasmodesmata",
    "abstract": "Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is delivered to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Although several functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP have been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach the PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Glycine substitutions in these motifs result in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at the PD. Taken together, these results suggest that both motifs are indispensable for targeting OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection but show differences in functionality. Co-immunoprecipitation assays coupled with mass spectrometry identified a series of host factors that could interact with the OuMV MP and link the MP with various pathways, in particular vesicle trafficking and membrane lipids. This study provides new insights into the intracellular targeting of MPs and pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.",

Recent work has shown that primary sensory areas can respond to and in some cases discriminate stimuli not of their target modality: for example, primary somatosensory cortex (SI) discriminates visual images of graspable objects. In the present work, we investigated whether SI would discriminate sounds depicting hand-object interactions (e.g. bouncing a ball). In a rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants listened attentively to sounds from three categories: hand-object interactions, and control categories of pure tones and animal vocalizations, while performing a one-back repetition detection task. Multi-voxel pattern analysis revealed significant decoding of different hand-object interactions within SI, but not for either control category. Crucially, in the hand-sensitive voxels defined from an independent tactile localizer, decoding accuracies were significantly higher for hand-object interactions compared to pure tones in left SI. Our findings indicate that simply hearing sounds depicting familiar hand-object interactions elicit different patterns of activity in SI, despite the complete absence of tactile stimulation. These results highlight the rich information that can be transmitted across sensory modalities even to primary sensory areas.",

The predictive value of the integrative approach was assessed using a library of target-annotated small molecules as benchmarks. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to compare in-class to out-of-class similarity, we found that SNF retains the ability to identify significant in-class similarity across a diverse set of target classes, and could also find target classes that were not detectable in either platform alone. This confirmed that integration of expression-based and image-based phenotypes can accurately report on MOA. Furthermore, we integrated untargeted metabolomics of complex natural product fractions with the SNF network to map biological signatures to specific metabolites. Three examples are presented where SNF coupled with metabolomics was used to directly functionally characterize natural products and accelerate identification of bioactive metabolites, including the discovery of the novel azoxy-containing biaryl compounds parkamycins A and B.

However, it is not clear whether {beta}-cell heterogeneity is stable or reflects dynamic cellular states. We investigated the temporal kinetics of endogenous insulin gene activity using live cell imaging, with complementary experiments employing FACS and single cell RNA sequencing, in {beta}-cells from Ins2GFP knock-in mice. In vivo staining and FACS analysis of islets from Ins2GFP mice confirmed that at a given moment, ~25% of {beta}-cells exhibited significantly higher activity at the conserved insulin gene Ins2. Live cell imaging captured Ins2 gene activity dynamics in single {beta}-cells over days. Autocorrelation analysis revealed a subset of cells with oscillating behavior, with mean oscillation periods of 17 hours. Increased glucose concentrations stimulated more cells to oscillate and resulted in higher average Ins2 gene activity per cell. Single cell RNA sequencing showed that Ins2(GFP)HIGH {beta}-cells were enriched for markers of {beta}-cell maturity. Ins2(GFP)HIGH {beta}-cells were also significantly less viable at all glucose concentrations and in the context of ER stress.

    "abstract": "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or  blue zones, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.",

    "title": "Increased presynaptic excitability in a migraine with aura mutation",
    "abstract": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. The headache and sensory amplifications that characterize migraine are attributed to hyperexcitable sensory circuits, but a detailed understanding remains elusive. This is partly due to the paucity of genetic animal models associated with the common, less severe form of the disease. A mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) was identified in familial migraine with aura and advanced sleep phase syndrome. Spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura, is facilitated in mice carrying one of the mutations (CK1{delta}T44A). However, the mechanism of this susceptibility is not known. We used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology and imaging, in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices, to understand the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of this apparent circuit excitability. We found that despite normal synaptic activity and hyperpolarized neuronal membrane potentials at rest, CK1{delta}T44A neurons were more excitable upon repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls. This was due to reduced presynaptic adaptation to high-frequency stimuli at excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses. Reduced adaptation at glutamatergic CK1{delta}T44A synapses was mediated by a calcium-dependent enhancement of the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. This caused an increase in the cumulative amplitude of excitatory currents, and a higher excitation-to-inhibition ratio during sustained activity, both in vivo and in brain slices. Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary motor control theories propose competition between multiple motor plans before the winning command is executed. While most competitions are completed prior to movement onset, movements are often initiated before the competition has been resolved. An example of this is saccadic averaging, wherein the eyes land at an intermediate location between two visual targets. Behavioral and neurophysiological signatures of competing motor commands have also been reported for reaching movements, but debate remains about whether such signatures attest to an unresolved competition, arise from averaging across many trials, or reflect a strategy to optimize behavior given task constraints. Here, we recorded electromyographic activity from an upper limb muscle (m. pectoralis) while twelve (8 female) participants performed an immediate response reach task, freely choosing between one of two identical and suddenly presented visual targets. On each trial, muscle recruitment showed two distinct phases of directionally-tuned activity. In the first wave, time-locked ~100 ms of target presentation, muscle activity was clearly influenced by the non-chosen target, reflecting a competition between reach commands that was biased in favor of the ultimately chosen target. This resulted in an initial movement intermediate between the two targets. In contrast, the second wave, time-locked to voluntary reach onset, was not biased toward the non-chosen target, showing that the competition between targets was resolved. Instead, this wave of activity compensated for the averaging induced by the first wave. Thus, single-trial analysis reveals an evolution in how the non-chosen target differentially influences the first and second wave of muscle activity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTContemporary theories of motor control suggest that multiple motor plans compete for selection before the winning command is executed. Evidence for this is found in intermediate reach movements towards two potential target locations, but recent findings have challenged this notion by arguing that intermediate reaching movements reflect an optimal response strategy. By examining upper limb muscle recruitment during a free-choice reach task, we show early recruitment of a sub-optimal averaged motor command to the two targets that subsequently transitions to a single motor command that compensates for the initially averaged motor command. Recording limb muscle activity permits single-trial resolution of the dynamic influence of the non-chosen target through time.",

    "abstract": "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or  blue zones, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.",

Resting state functional and anatomical MRI data from 100 healthy subjects were analyzed; taken from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, NIH Blueprint: The Human Connectome Project), with 2x2x2 mm3 voxel resolution. Positive functional connectivity was found (p<0.05, FDR corrected) between the claustrum and the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, pre-central and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and subcortical areas. Our findings coincide with the results previously reported in both animal models and studies with humans.

    "title": "Increased presynaptic excitability in a migraine with aura mutation",
    "abstract": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. The headache and sensory amplifications that characterize migraine are attributed to hyperexcitable sensory circuits, but a detailed understanding remains elusive. This is partly due to the paucity of genetic animal models associated with the common, less severe form of the disease. A mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) was identified in familial migraine with aura and advanced sleep phase syndrome. Spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura, is facilitated in mice carrying one of the mutations (CK1{delta}T44A). However, the mechanism of this susceptibility is not known. We used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology and imaging, in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices, to understand the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of this apparent circuit excitability. We found that despite normal synaptic activity and hyperpolarized neuronal membrane potentials at rest, CK1{delta}T44A neurons were more excitable upon repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls. This was due to reduced presynaptic adaptation to high-frequency stimuli at excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses. Reduced adaptation at glutamatergic CK1{delta}T44A synapses was mediated by a calcium-dependent enhancement of the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. This caused an increase in the cumulative amplitude of excitatory currents, and a higher excitation-to-inhibition ratio during sustained activity, both in vivo and in brain slices. Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerave diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are oten associated with mutaons in proteins that are associated with stress granules. Stress granules are condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separaon which, when aberrant, can lead to altered condensaon behaviours and disease phenotypes. Here, we identified lipoamide, a small molecule which specifically prevents cytoplasmic condensaon of stress granule proteins. Thermal proteome profiling showed that lipoamide preferentially stabilises intrinsically disordered domain-containing proteins. These include SRSF1 and SFPQ, stress granule proteins necessary for lipoamide activity. The redox state of SFPQ correlates with its condensate-dissolving behaviour, in concordance with the importance of the dithiolane ring for lipoamide activity. In animals, lipoamide ameliorates aging-associated aggregaon of a stress granule reporter, improves neuronal morphology, and recovers motor defects caused by expression of ALS-associated FUS and TDP-43 mutants. In conclusion, lipoamide is a well-tolerated small molecule modulator of stress granule condensaon and dissection of its molecular mechanism identified a cellular pathway for redox regulaon of stress granule formaon.",

    "abstract": "Physiological homeostasis becomes compromised during aging, as a result of impairment of cellular processes, including transcription and RNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here, we profiled and analyzed genome-wide, aging-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematode worms, fruit flies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (Pol-II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin/Igf signaling, both reversed most of these aging-related changes. Genetic variants in Pol-II that reduced its speed in worms and flies increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing Pol-II speed by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal aging and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventative measures.",

    "title": "Sorting motifs target the movement protein of ourmia melon virus to the trans-Golgi network and plasmodesmata",
    "abstract": "Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is delivered to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Although several functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP have been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach the PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Glycine substitutions in these motifs result in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at the PD. Taken together, these results suggest that both motifs are indispensable for targeting OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection but show differences in functionality. Co-immunoprecipitation assays coupled with mass spectrometry identified a series of host factors that could interact with the OuMV MP and link the MP with various pathways, in particular vesicle trafficking and membrane lipids. This study provides new insights into the intracellular targeting of MPs and pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.",

    "abstract": "Neurons, even in earliest sensory regions of cortex, are subject to a great deal of contextual influences from both within and across modality connections. Recent work has shown that primary sensory areas can respond to and in some cases discriminate stimuli not of their target modality: for example, primary somatosensory cortex (SI) discriminates visual images of graspable objects. In the present work, we investigated whether SI would discriminate sounds depicting hand-object interactions (e.g. bouncing a ball). In a rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants listened attentively to sounds from three categories: hand-object interactions, and control categories of pure tones and animal vocalizations, while performing a one-back repetition detection task. Multi-voxel pattern analysis revealed significant decoding of different hand-object interactions within SI, but not for either control category. Crucially, in the hand-sensitive voxels defined from an independent tactile localizer, decoding accuracies were significantly higher for hand-object interactions compared to pure tones in left SI. Our findings indicate that simply hearing sounds depicting familiar hand-object interactions elicit different patterns of activity in SI, despite the complete absence of tactile stimulation. These results highlight the rich information that can be transmitted across sensory modalities even to primary sensory areas.",

    "title": "High-Throughput Functional Annotation of Natural Products by Integrated Activity Profiling",
    "abstract": "Determining mechanism of action (MOA) is one of the biggest challenges in natural products discovery. Here, we report a comprehensive platform that uses Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) to improve MOA predictions by integrating data from the cytological profiling high-content imaging platform and the gene expression platform FUSION, and pairs these data with untargeted metabolomics analysis for de novo bioactive compound discovery. The predictive value of the integrative approach was assessed using a library of target-annotated small molecules as benchmarks. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to compare in-class to out-of-class similarity, we found that SNF retains the ability to identify significant in-class similarity across a diverse set of target classes, and could also find target classes that were not detectable in either platform alone. This confirmed that integration of expression-based and image-based phenotypes can accurately report on MOA. Furthermore, we integrated untargeted metabolomics of complex natural product fractions with the SNF network to map biological signatures to specific metabolites. Three examples are presented where SNF coupled with metabolomics was used to directly functionally characterize natural products and accelerate identification of bioactive metabolites, including the discovery of the novel azoxy-containing biaryl compounds parkamycins A and B. Our results support SNF integration of multiple phenotypic screening approaches along with untargeted metabolomics as a powerful approach for advancing natural products drug discovery.\n\nSignificance statementNew data-driven methods to aid in the discovery and biological characterization of natural products are necessary to advance the field. Assigning the mechanism of action (MOA) to novel bioactive compounds is an essential step in drug discovery and a major challenge in chemical biology. Despite technological advances in isolation, synthesis and screening strategies that make many bioactive substances readily available, in most cases their biological targets remain unknown. Additionally, a major bottleneck in natural products discovery efforts is de-replication of the large number of known compounds that predominate in crude extracts and fraction libraries. Advances in metabolomics has provided a better understanding of the constituents present in these libraries, but is not sufficient in itself to drive the discovery of novel biologically active metabolites. Here we describe an unbiased, data-driven strategy which integrates phenotypic screening with metabolomics into a single platform that provides rapid identification and functional annotation of natural products. This approach can be applied to any cohort of uncharacterized chemicals and represents a strategy that could significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery.",

Ins2(GFP)HIGH {beta}-cells were also significantly less viable at all glucose concentrations and in the context of ER stress. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the heterogeneity of insulin production, observed in mouse and human {beta}-cells, can be accounted for by dynamic states of insulin gene activity.\n\nBlurbPreviously reported pancreatic {beta}-cell heterogeneity reflects {beta}-cell state transitions.",

    "title": "Supercentenarian and remarkable age records exhibit patterns indicative of clerical errors and pension fraud",
    "abstract": "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or  blue zones, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.",

    "title": "The functional connectivity of the human claustrum according to the Human Connectome Project database",
    "abstract": "The claustrum is an irregular and fine sheet of grey matter in the basolateral telencephalon present in almost all mammals. The claustrum has been the object of several studies using animal models and more recently in human beings using neuroimaging. Believed to be involved in cognition and disease such as fear recognition, suppression of natural urges, multisensory integration, conceptual integration, seizures, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinsons disease. Nevertheless, the function of the claustrum still remains unclear. We present a functional connectivity study of the claustrum in order to identify its main networks. Resting state functional and anatomical MRI data from 100 healthy subjects were analyzed; taken from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, NIH Blueprint: The Human Connectome Project), with 2x2x2 mm3 voxel resolution. Positive functional connectivity was found (p<0.05, FDR corrected) between the claustrum and the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, pre-central and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and subcortical areas. Our findings coincide with the results previously reported in both animal models and studies with humans. Showing the claustrum as a well-connected structure not only structurally but also functionally. Evidencing the claustrum as a node participating in different neural networks.",

    "title": "Increased presynaptic excitability in a migraine with aura mutation",
    "abstract": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. The headache and sensory amplifications that characterize migraine are attributed to hyperexcitable sensory circuits, but a detailed understanding remains elusive. This is partly due to the paucity of genetic animal models associated with the common, less severe form of the disease. A mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) was identified in familial migraine with aura and advanced sleep phase syndrome. Spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura, is facilitated in mice carrying one of the mutations (CK1{delta}T44A). However, the mechanism of this susceptibility is not known. We used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology and imaging, in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices, to understand the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of this apparent circuit excitability. We found that despite normal synaptic activity and hyperpolarized neuronal membrane potentials at rest, CK1{delta}T44A neurons were more excitable upon repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls. This was due to reduced presynaptic adaptation to high-frequency stimuli at excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses. Reduced adaptation at glutamatergic CK1{delta}T44A synapses was mediated by a calcium-dependent enhancement of the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. This caused an increase in the cumulative amplitude of excitatory currents, and a higher excitation-to-inhibition ratio during sustained activity, both in vivo and in brain slices. Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",
